(Video attached.). We had a failure at the piping connection before and your team fixed the broken fuel nozzle piping two weeks ago on June 22. So we have concerns about this leakage if the piping breaks. The breakage can directly affect the nozzle and we do not have any nozzle spare.. Gasket has been replaced, water injection tubing line has been replaced together with compression fitting and ferrule. After this no water leakages found. The day after the customer highlighted some leakages between liquid fuel nozzle and main nozzle body, not found during our following inspection on site. There is to consider that scenario is completely different if leakage is present or not and specially if leakages is water or liquid fuel. Is clear that in case of water leakages the main issue is to remove the water from ground floor of baseplate but in case of liquid fuel leakages is completely another story with possible risk of fire event. For this reason we recommend to the customer to check periodically the presence of leakages, and in case of liquid fuel leakages from point indicated (see mail attached), replace the spring C seal item 9 code KFZ293720004..

      "Query: On the 5th of June 2019 post the L1 service startup, the Train2 PR2 High Speed Power Turbine (HSPT) vibration readings on the casing accelerometer started trending up close to the trip limit of 25mm/s. The increase in the casing vibration is confirmed to be only on Tr2PR2 and not on other units. Multiple hypotheses exists ranging from residual varnish deposition on HSPT journal bearing 1, restriction in thermal growth, rotor unbalance, rotor-dynamics changes, and bearing 1 damage. The root cause of the casing vibration has not yet been determined. The most likely hypotheses are: 1. Actual mechanical damage on the HSPT bearings.. 2. The effects of MLO DTE-932 and residual varnish on this HSPT bearing 1. . From the current RM&D trend we could see that the vibration on the sesmic probe and the proximeter probes have reduced and the behaviour is consistent with the vibration levels observed prior to oil replacement activity during L1. Oil varnish is considered to be a contributing factor for the vibration spike. . With the above finding there is no requirement to increase the sesmic vibration limit from 25 mm/sec to 35 mm/sec, further after discussion with level 3 the sesmic vibration setpoint increase from 25mm/sec to 35mm/sec cannot be approved as this affects the HSPT integrity.\n",

      "Saturday 2nd June at 23:02:40 the Refrigeration steam turbine trip for HH vibration at Journal bearing Drive End (8501VAHH0857X). (see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. . In first analysis I suppose that this TRIP was cause from an issue on PESS (PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC SAFETY SYSTEM) from customer side.. The customer could verify the wiring connection and screw tightening..

CPR was to high at this conditions, as per trend analysis the IBH was going to fully open conditions as per control logic to bring the CPR down. The FSR suppression has been activated by CPR_Limit control (FSR_CONRTOL=11), but the CPR limit still decreasing due to IGV keeps going to minimum position. As per SW comments, when the FSR CPR_Limit is active the IGV minimum position should be locked to current position to avoid the further decrease of CPR Limit threshold, currently this feature is not present in Yamal LNG control SW..

      "Query: Manitowoc Public Utilities Frame 5 CT Issues. Background: The unit was last successfully started and run on 1/10 for a short run to test a new auto synchronizing relay. Temperatures were typical for Wisconsin at the time (25-30 degrees). Yesterday (1/30), we were requested to start our CT and be online at around 0500. Temperatures were about minus 20 degrees with blowing snow. We also had a significant snow fall on Monday (12+ inches) with major blowing and drifting. So that is the background for our start.. We started the unit on NG around 0500 in the morning and synched onto the grid. After our normal 10 minute warm up period at 2 MW load was increased to ~11.5 MW. The unit appeared to be stable and running at ~11.5 MW for just over 1/2 hour when it tripped. Unfortunately the exact cause is now a bit hard to determine as our control PLC is not logging alarm history (a separate issue we are looking into). While it was all happening, I ended up hitting a reset, thinking I could go back to the alarm history, but the history is not there. There were a number of alarms and I know at least one Shutdown alarm was OVERSPEED TRIP. However, we did not see indication that speed got that high (108%). If it did it was very short.. After the unit rolled down and became ready for a restart, we attempted a 2nd start. At about 60% speed the unit tripped on High Vibration of the #2 Turbine Bearing (Trips at 1 in/sec. velocity). The vibrations are definitely real, as we could feel it on the startup. We suspected the trip from load with the extreme cold temperatures could have caused a bow in the shaft. We left the unit on the jack for about 7 hours. We were again asked to run and attempted another start around 1400. This time the unit tripped on High Exhaust Gas Temp and High Vibration at the same time. Vibration has typically not been an issue with this unit, and we are at a loss as to the cause of the High EGT.. Finally, for some additional information, we looked at the trends from the initial run and trip and can see there were 4 or 5 instances of significant MW load spikes (2+ MW swings in very short time frame). These swings corresponds with spikes in the Inter-Stage Gas Pressure. I believe that the NG header pressure regulator was sticking, causing spikes in the supply header pressure as the unit was running. These spikes resulted in sudden power surges in the turbine, which ultimately lead to the trip. Assesment provided based on the GE philosophy of control and not based on how the 3rd party control panel operates. Borescope inspection is recommended. No changes on control system is recommended at this time as this is not a GE supplied control system.. . Potential turbine parts failure.

The unit is under operation but is facing problems with the lub oil system. Local FSE in Venezuela is not available.. . Branch: Nuovo Pignone, Model: BCL-303, Serial Number: 10689. NP CENTRIFUGAL COMPRESSOR, EL PALITO REFINERY. Customer needs our FSE assistance on site for around 3 or 4 working days. The unit is under operation but is facing problems with the lub oil system. Local FSE in Venezuela is not available. . More technical details: . Client has been having some issues with a NP centrifugal compressor of the PtR Unit and they have done a lot of things to eliminate those issues but now they need a GE techinician to help them find the correct solution to this matter. . This compressor has a Lube & Seal Oil System, attached the diagrams. The mechanical seals are from EagleBurgman.. This is an overview of the differents troubles they are having. See the diagrams attached as a reference to the comments.. 1. Frequent failures of the mechanical seals. Sometimes this is because of the sudden loss of diferential pressure of the Seal Oil System.. 2. Poor hermeticity of the mechanical seals in the housing because of posible wrong selection of o'rings.. 3. A lot of oil flowing out the mechanical seals. The amount of oil we see in the flow oil glasses located in the drain lines is too much and apparently abnormal. We've checked the mechanical seals faces for excesive wear, craks, etc. and they're most of the times \"OK\". No signs of separation of the faces that could get the oil flowing out them increased.. 4. Sudden lose of Reference and Equalization Gas, then the situation gets into control but sometimes it doesn't and it makes dificult to maintain the system in control.. 5. Lube & Seal Oil System working with the main and auxiliary pump in service at the same time. When we try to get out of service one pump we get the diferential pressure decreased and it can shut down the compressor.. 6. Oil Accumulator Tank doesn't respond as it should.. 7. A lot of instability and poor control of the system valves associated to Lube & Seal Oil System (PDCV, PCVs, etc.).. The problems mentioned above have been in this machine since the 90's, in those years they received the assistance of some NP's technicians, Burgmann's technicians and others and they give some recomendations to eliminate those instability problems. The recomendations that they give were carried out and for several years they didn't have problems but they are having similar problems right now. We've reached the OEM of the mechanical seals to give a response about the design of the MS and some improves wanted to have in order to eliminate some issues but we haven't had any respond..

      "Query: Seeking advise on ST problem. Good after noon, I am Kraisorn who response in rotating machine maintenance in Bangchak refinery.. We have problem about the steam turbine 4KT-4001.. Now, Governor open about 90% at speed 7,900 rpm. Normally we operate at 8,300 rpm but now can't increase speed to that point.. We check the 1st stage pressure, It has trend to increase since mid of October until now this value is 38 bar (Inlet pressure 40 bar). The turbine NDE axial vibration change from -0.20 mm to -0.02 mm but other vibration are normal.. Could you please advise about this problem and how to check and method to solve this problem . Thank you for your support.. Here below the questions/answers exchanged during the call.. 1 While turbine run at speed around 7,500 rpm, can we introduce the superheat steam (Dry steam) but have margin temp. higher than saturated steam a little bit to washing the turbine ? In order to try washing the turbine the steam has to be saturated. Keeping a temperature in between the operating superheated and the saturated one would be not effective. Moreover, it's strongly not advisable to play with the temperature while the turbine run at high speed, in fact possible water slugs could compromise the machine integrity. The steam may be condensed to wet steam after pass first or second stage and then washing the deposit on the stage after. Can we use this method to washing the turbine ? see above. How much the pressure and temperature that recommend ? see above. What are the concern for this method ? see above. 2 While washing turbine at 500 rpm, steam should be wetted before entrance the turbine that mean wet steam may be condensed before last stage. The washing may not efficient it can cause unbalance or vibration problem after washing or not. As already explained in the very first replies, vibration issues could happen after washing, but they would be not due to washing efficiency. Depending on the thickness and 'hardness' of the deposits, they could be removed not evenly and therefore provoke unbalance. 3 From guide line no. 1-2, Why need to shut down the turbine and cool down casing to 100 C after that start up again to 1,500 rpm. The aim is to induce some thermal transients that should facilitate the deposits detaching (due to the different thermal expansion between steel and deposits). 4 When run turbine at 500 rpm, how to keep compressor run ? Because there are not enough pressure for sealing DGS. If you have not clean external buffer gas, this could be a problem.. 5 Can we remove coupling spacer then washing the turbine during solo run ? Governor valve can control turbine speed at 500 rpm when solo run or not. Usually Yes. 6 If governor valve cannot control speed at 500 rpm. Are there speed allowance for this procedure ? Less than 700 rpm. 7 Are there any detail procedure for wet steam washing ? Please submit to us. How much steam temperature decreasing rate when open BFW valve ? Depends on the plant arrangement. Best practice is always to look for temperature stabilization (about 5 minutes) before to increase the BFW opening.. 8 Please submit the control limit of conductivity (<0.1 mS/cm), SiO2 (< 5 ppm) or etc for BFW. BFW (Boiler Feed Water) properties provided are the ones we specify for a good operation of our steam turbines. What we can say is that the washing will be as much effective as the BFW properties will be closed to the specified. 9 Are there any procedure to clean turbine when turbine stop ? . For example, turbine stop we fill up water inside the turbine and then rotate shaft by turning device to rinse the contaminate and drain out.. Please advise. No. 10 Could you please advise start up step after washing finish ? . Should we stop the turbine to drain out or increase speed to 1,500 rpm and continue warming up ?. Are there need longer warm up than normally start up ?. During the washing, the machine drains shall be kept open (consequent loss of vacuum is not an issue). Once the washing is finished, slightly close the BFW valve and wait for the superheated temperature stabilization. Keep the temperature stable for 5 minutes and then close the drains.. From this point, increase the speed from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. Warm up for 10 minutes @ 1500 rpm and then follow the normal start-up ramps.. 11 Check the schedule of GE supervisor to supervise washing procedure as soon as possible. Joe to provide answer. 12 When washing turbine with 500 rpm, if there are BFW in liquid state go through the turbine. What're the effect for turbine ? . Being the BFW valve Â½\" size, no major water slugs are expected. Moreover, making the washing at 500 rpm limits the risk of damages.. 13 From guide line item 1, Turbine shall cool down to 100 C. Kindly advise where is the position on the casing to measure temperature. Is it TI-530 or use infrared temp to check at casing surface ? OK. 14 Due to our time constrain, Are there any method to cool down the turbine faster than natural cool down ?Can we remove the insulation out to faster cool down ? Absolutely NOT . From your experience, can you advise estimate time for cool down the turbine ? 6-8 hours. 15 Kindly advise essentially concern and caution for startup after turbine washing finish. See point 10.

      "After the major overhaul of our steam turbine (type HG 50/40-3), we are now experiencing high vibrations (max 108 microns) especially on NDE side (steam end) of the turbine. According to our initial analysis, it is likely that there is a bow on the rotor. One of the possible improvement options that we think of is slow rolling the machine. Here we have couple of questions for Nuovo Pignone as the OEM of this machine.. - What is the slow roll speed for this machine? . - Is there a minimum RPM limitation for slow rolling due to lubrication properties? . - Is there an OEM procedure for rotor stretching? .

      "Dear Luis,. If I correctly understood, you are going to replace both HPT and LPT on PK-172 unit. If it is correct, I would proceed as follows: . 1 - I would close this SR 90368181.. 2 - Once the new HPT and LPT will be installed at site, I would collect running parameters of the new unit and I would upload them in a new SR ( linked to old SR 90368181) , asking for a comment on new recorded data. This findings, depending on HPTs speed lack still there or that, will reveal if the problem was addressable to something outside module ( Anti Surge Valve, VSV schedule by UCP) or to the module itself.. 3 - If the problem wont be resolved by module swap, it will be sufficient the new SR above, as we will have to focus on something still at site and not related to engine. On the opposite, if the problem will be fixed, it will be necessary a second new SR, to define a dedicated checklist to inspect the modules ( HPT and LPT) at the workshop to try to detect what causes the poor HPT speed.. If it is fine to you, I would invite you to proceed as above.. Thanks. Riccardo. Hi Rene,. as requested I am going to close this SR; looking forward to future update in a new SR.. Regards. Ciao.

      "After a pressurized shutdown is not possible to restart the unit due to missing permissive from antisurge controller (AS1_L3AS_RTS) because during SOP state (around 11-12 BarG) the compressors stages inlet pressure transmitters are out of scale giving a fault to antisurge controller.. Based on IL, SOL47654, the instruments at site should be Honeywell STG840 with a calibration range available of -1Ã·35barg.. We calculated the reference and the expected accuracy in case of calibration span increase to -1Ã·15barg: the reference accuracy would be 9mbar (about 1% of reading in normal operating condition).. On the 8th of August, we recommended to increase the calibration span of the instruments as follow for next start up (both instrument and controller): - PIT5643 from -1 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2640 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2644 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2639from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2641 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2642 from 0 min. to +15 barg.. Site team has already implemented the above mentioned calibration range and tested the AntiSurge controller operation to be smooth at the following startup.. On the 26th of August Site team has communicated \"we tested the modification and it is working fine. we can go ahead for as-built and case closure\". Therefore the above mentioned calibration range modification is confirmed and we can proceed with Field Instrument List SOL49566 as-built issuing.. The specified calibration range was too small (SOP out of range) and not suitable for pressurized shutdown. (score: 0.4915)\n",

      "Saturday 2nd June at 23:02:40 the Refrigeration steam turbine trip for HH vibration at Journal bearing Drive End (8501VAHH0857X). (see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. .

      "Le client souhaiterait que nous analysions les donnÃ©es vibratoire du compresseur durant le test des 72h et que nous puissions rÃ©pondre Ã ses commentaires. Damien, Abdelaziz, Jeremie,. Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. . (score: 0.4778)\n",

Client has been having some issues with a NP centrifugal compressor of the PtR Unit and they have done a lot of things to eliminate those issues but now they need a GE techinician to help them find the correct solution to this matter. . This compressor has a Lube & Seal Oil System, attached the diagrams. The mechanical seals are from EagleBurgman.. This is an overview of the differents troubles they are having. See the diagrams attached as a reference to the comments.. 1. Frequent failures of the mechanical seals. Sometimes this is because of the sudden loss of diferential pressure of the Seal Oil System.. 2. Poor hermeticity of the mechanical seals in the housing because of posible wrong selection of o'rings.. 3. A lot of oil flowing out the mechanical seals. The amount of oil we see in the flow oil glasses located in the drain lines is too much and apparently abnormal. We've checked the mechanical seals faces for excesive wear, craks, etc. and they're most of the times \"OK\". No signs of separation of the faces that could get the oil flowing out them increased.. 4. Sudden lose of Reference and Equalization Gas, then the situation gets into control but sometimes it doesn't and it makes dificult to maintain the system in control.. 5. Lube & Seal Oil System working with the main and auxiliary pump in service at the same time. When we try to get out of service one pump we get the diferential pressure decreased and it can shut down the compressor.. 6. Oil Accumulator Tank doesn't respond as it should.. 7. A lot of instability and poor control of the system valves associated to Lube & Seal Oil System (PDCV, PCVs, etc.).. The problems mentioned above have been in this machine since the 90's, in those years they received the assistance of some NP's technicians, Burgmann's technicians and others and they give some recomendations to eliminate those instability problems. The recomendations that they give were carried out and for several years they didn't have problems but they are having similar problems right now.

      "During the cold day restart of Yamal LNG Train1 String B (ambient temperature -33 degC) unit tripped few seconds after EOS, due to LCPRERR â Compressor Operating Limit Control At Max. CPR was to high at this conditions, as per trend analysis the IBH was going to fully open conditions as per control logic to bring the CPR down. The FSR suppression has been activated by CPR_Limit control (FSR_CONRTOL=11), but the CPR limit still decreasing due to IGV keeps going to minimum position. As per SW comments, when the FSR CPR_Limit is active the IGV minimum position should be locked to current position to avoid the further decrease of CPR Limit threshold, currently this feature is not present in Yamal LNG control SW..

      "With reference to Service Requests 90329434 and 90329219. Gas turbine (Serial No: 850050) have a leakage on fuel nozzle inlet piping at 6th Nozzle that your team have changed two weeks ago. (Video attached.). We had a failure at the piping connection before and your team fixed the broken fuel nozzle piping two weeks ago on June 22. So we have concerns about this leakage if the piping breaks. The breakage can directly affect the nozzle and we do not have any nozzle spare.. Gasket has been replaced, water injection tubing line has been replaced together with compression fitting and ferrule. After this no water leakages found. The day after the customer highlighted some leakages between liquid fuel nozzle and main nozzle body, not found during our following inspection on site. There is to consider that scenario is completely different if leakage is present or not and specially if leakages is water or liquid fuel. Is clear that in case of water leakages the main issue is to remove the water from ground floor of baseplate but in case of liquid fuel leakages is completely another story with possible risk of fire event. For this reason we recommend to the customer to check periodically the presence of leakages, and in case of liquid fuel leakages from point indicated (see mail attached), replace the spring C seal item 9 code KFZ293720004.. Request about water injection leakages. (score: 0.5542)\n",

So we have concerns about this leakage if the piping breaks. The breakage can directly affect the nozzle and we do not have any nozzle spare.. Gasket has been replaced, water injection tubing line has been replaced together with compression fitting and ferrule. After this no water leakages found. The day after the customer highlighted some leakages between liquid fuel nozzle and main nozzle body, not found during our following inspection on site. There is to consider that scenario is completely different if leakage is present or not and specially if leakages is water or liquid fuel. Is clear that in case of water leakages the main issue is to remove the water from ground floor of baseplate but in case of liquid fuel leakages is completely another story with possible risk of fire event. For this reason we recommend to the customer to check periodically the presence of leakages, and in case of liquid fuel leakages from point indicated (see mail attached), replace the spring C seal item 9 code KFZ293720004..

When we were starting the GTC we faced H temp on TT-0401 above 60 Â°C, and customer ask to close it to cooldown the temperature.. To do it, we need force manually the software AO- a20rcy2 from 0% up to 70 % and keep temperature below 50 Â°C.. No Popup is available â¦at the moment the only way to adj it, is force from the SW. Pls for more detail refere to the e-mail attached to the case: VSP - 23TV0410_A --_ a20rcy2 TY-0410_A ( ) TEMPERATURE CONTROL VALVE POSITIONER TRANSMITTER.msg. After involving the process operability team, we confirm that the valve in subject must be operated always in manual. The purpose is to heat up the suction to avoid hydrates formation. The valve must be kept fully open under all operating conditions.. With this approach the most critical scenario is when the AS is open. In this case if the temperature on TT-0401 will increase to a high value the position of the valve shall be reduced from 100% full open to a lower percentage with 5% steps (value to be determined at Site during running tests). Once the best value will be found, the valve will be maintained in manual. Not automatic operation is allowed. To facilitate the operation we can add a valve control object on process page \"COMMON_TAPIDC00.CIM\" to be configured as per the attached file. One more modification to be done inside the software is to change the format spec on A26CRY from Â°C to PCT.. Cimplicity object configuration for temperature control valve on process.

      "Saturday 2nd June at 23:02:40 the Refrigeration steam turbine trip for HH vibration at Journal bearing Drive End (8501VAHH0857X). (see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. . In first analysis I suppose that this TRIP was cause from an issue on PESS (PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC SAFETY SYSTEM) from customer side.. The customer could verify the wiring connection and screw tightening..

      "Le client souhaiterait que nous analysions les donnÃ©es vibratoire du compresseur durant le test des 72h et que nous puissions rÃ©pondre Ã ses commentaires. Damien, Abdelaziz, Jeremie,. Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. . (score: 0.4642)\n",

      "During AO command and AI feedback loopcheck of the PCV-4430 (RVO-6733568 Samson 3252 valve) valve has been found an issue with the positioner of the valve because the valve (is FO) cannot be closed at 100% with 20mA but only at 93%. To close completely the valve are necessary 22mA. Stroking the valve is visible a systematic error between command and feedback of around 5/7%.. It was suggested to sent the valve to calibrate in laboratory, but the customer during my absence tried to adjust the stem of the valve to recover the gap of the valve.. The customer send me an e-mail(attached) with their tests done and now is requesting a solution or a new positioner.. Pay attention please: defective system filling not correct. Problem involves a valve mounted on compressor seal gas system. Item not found because SR was opened for steam turbine job instead of compressor job. .

At site the limit switches of the anti-surge valves are connected to the PLC 2 which is steam turbine governor control PLC 2 and its as per the attached UCP wiring diagram and loop diagram, . however in the Job PID and Field instrument and IO list, its indicated that the limit switches are connected to the PLC 1 which is wrong. Hence the PID and Field instrument and IO list needs to be revised to show the actual connections . Please review markup of the attached PID and Field instrument and IO list and confirm. As discussed with design team, In Anti-surge PLC, we are using position transmitter. These antisurge valve limit switch signals 114-ZSH/ZSL- 1051 are not required to be connected to Antisurge PLC. Where governor need to know open limit position as part of start permissive and generate trip during shutdown, so these signals are connected to PLC-2. . So, below mentioned documents need to be update accordingly. . SOK0880102 : Sheet-13. SOL14684 : Sheet-26. As per control schematic diagram SOL21717, PLC-1 to be used for Antisurge system, whereas PLC-2 used for Governer control .. But Two antisurge signals (114-ZSH/ZSL- 1051) is connected with PLC-2, which are followed the UCP wiring diagram SOL3345145_sheet-169. . So, site wants to update the affected documents as per site wiring configuration. (score: 1.0000)\n",
      "On PAB platform is operating a unit not covered by our CSA contract: however the client is asking help on following issue, please refer below description. Attached you can find formal request came by client with m6b attached. Quote. we are having some issues with our Booster Compressor K0401-01. The recycle valve is opening to values of 80-90% and it is apparently due to the detection of surge, therefore the surge control logic increases the setpoint of the controller forcing it to open faster. We havent been able to find process reasons for such a sudden change, but when looking at it closer our Rotating Equipment engineer has determined that the compressor is operating at incipient surge region, meaning that the Surge Control Line (SCL) is actually at the incipient surge region.. Unquote. . See attached mail customer agree to close the SR because they are going to shutdown the unit for UCP upgrade. But I still suggest to record the issue, keep the following information to the control requisition engineer in this upgrade in order to anticipate issue in future.. ----------------------------------. According to Walter's statement, if it is a sudden open instead of steady open, most likely the 'transient absorption' is ON. This is a designed regulation/protection, as a feature of anti-surge controller. Usually it be activated when process condition change ratio exceed a certain threshold. For example, fluctuation on flow measurement. If it is a steady open, it means operation point is approaching to SCL.. However, in order to help customer evaluate this 'transient absorption' activation event, we still need to start with data analysis. Please get the required data.. The possibilities will include but not limited to: . - A real process fluctuation. - A slight process fluctuation with a too sensitive detection parameter tuned. - A instrumentation / cabling issue which introduce noise in loop. - A steady operation with insufficient suction flow. About raised questions by customer: . Q1.Can we operate the KT-0401 in the long term with 40% (once in a while -95%) open recycle valves?. A: as for equipment itself, there is no issue. However, it is of energy waste. If ASV staying stable at 40%, that usually means there is not enough suction flow to feed compressor at that speed (if suction and discharge pressure ratio is to be maintained). Customer may consider lower compressor speed manually or regulated by process controller. After we receive the data, we can have more precise evaluation. . Q2.We may have to adjust the SCL even more to the right? Or have a study carried out how to modify the unit?. A: If the suction condition ( including suction temperature, pressure, gas molecular weight is not far away from designed condition, there is no need to shift SCL in general, unless the set SCL has issue which may be seen from data analysis and other check on e.g flow element sheet. This can be discuss later.. customer request for technical support. (score: 0.5881)\n",

If the access to enclosure command is set then: -The admission procedure active alarm is raised. -15 minutes before the expiration of the timer the Loss of ventilation disabled: 15 min to. expire alarm is raised.. ----Question 1:Currently the value is set at 2 hours. Can you confirm that we can adjust this value up to 8 hours if requested?. ___________________. ___________________. 2)On the GTC only we have a Low Enclosure pressure alarm K63BTL_ALM2 that is enable before the activation setpoint of the second fan, in order to alert the operator in advance.. We would like to increase this value from his current value from 9.84 mmH2O to 16mmH2O in order to have an earlier alert. Second fan activation setpoint is currently at 8 mmH2O.. -----Question 2: Do you see any problem with that?. As by offshore procedure, this case is to have a second engineering opinion before implementation.. Question 1: Currently the value is set at 2 hours. Can you confirm that we can adjust this value up to 8 hours if requested?. Yes, this is confirmed. Under the SIS controller, Control constant K2TB_MAX currently set to 2 hours could be modified to 8 hours.. Question 2: talks about an early alarm warning K63BTL_ALM2. I was able to pull data from the OSM to see what the ball park value for the compartment Differential pressure operation is. I can see that the compartment is running between 29.5 and 30.5 mmH2OD. Based on this, I do not see a problem with Modifying the early warning alarm from 10mmH2o to 16mmH2o.. Question 1: Currently the value is set at 2 hours.

      "P77- OFFSHORE. During the operation of the turbogenerators the operational team requested clarification on the open-door alarm in the Enclosure while there was only low pressure in the enclosure, this event occurred during the start while there was low pressurizing and in the second moment when the machine was in motoring after normal STOP. The customer requests that this alarm be implemented only when in fact the port is open, associating the limit switches port switches.. In Logic ST toolbox the L63BTL signal (Diff pressure transmitter pressure low) maintains the Encl condition. Press Low- Unauthorized - Access- Alarm L63BTBPZ_ALM. Thus, the alarm is only associated at low pressure. The customer made access in enclosure in operation this alarm was associated correctly in the diagnosis of the fault, but the association of the same alarm only with the low pressure in the compartment makes the customer understand that there was human access in the instant that only the pressure was low.. See the attached document for a better understanding.. . the customer proposal is not recommended, the alarm should appear in any case (OR). Support FSE for modification request (score: 0.5307)\n",

As you can see by the drawing the VFD will turn on only when you give the start command to the motor.. In order to see the configuration from site we removed the power cables from MCC to the motor and we gave the start command.. The VFD was not configured. Following ABB manual and our specs documentation SG-8200680 and SG-8200027 we set up some variables. But still to confirm if the variables inserted are correct.. Following the manual, when the variables related to the motor are changed is needed an ID run first, in order to do a tuning of the motor and set the remaining parameters, but in our situation is not possible to select the ID run cause the device will start only when we give the start command.. After site conference call on 9-09-16, we attach mark up of mcc wiring SOM6758655 in order to solve the issue regarding the power supply.. This is valid for VFD that drive motors 88FC-1, 88FC-2, 88FC-3, 88BA-1, 88BA-2.. We require also to submit the configuration of VFD parameters done at site for supplier approval..

      "please be aware that, following the Steam Turbine Start-Up carried out on the past Friday 2nd of August, the below listed issues still affect the machine: . • 1. Excess of sealing system steam consumption. The sealing systema steam consumption is much greater than in the run before the Steam Turbine Overhaul. In fact, the steam flowing throw the PV-123 is about 230 kg/h (against about 190 kg/h in the previous run at a PIC-123 pressure set equal to 0,3 barg;. • 2. Fault of the Axial Displacement Sensor ZT-52-0304B. The axial displacement sensor failed and the following alarms are displayed in the Steam Turbine HMI: . o PLC1.BNALM.ZAH520304B;. o PLC1.BNALM.Z_NOK520304B;. o PLC1.BNALM.ZAHH520304B.. Please urgently provide us with the remedial actions to put in place in order to restore the safe and reliable conditions of the machine run.. Looking forward your urgent reply I ask you to dedicate to Sper the due attention as per the Contract in place and the Client history. 1- excessive steam leakage: according to client answers (attached), the flow is measured (and increase of temperature in the flash tank), so there are no doubt about increase in flow. The operating conditions are also same as before. we reviewed the clearance record from site and we had comments and found 2 factors that may explain the excessive leaks compared to design (attached powerpoint presentation). After discussion with the FSE, the measurement were the same at dissassembly and reassembly. There did not replace the seals as they were in good condition. Due to short outage timing, discrepencies observed were noted in the report and shall be taken into account for preparation of next major overhaul (fixed seals damaged (radial - axial), removed, diaphrams damaged).. The difference of leak before and after outage of 40 kg/h described by client could therefore be explained : . -potential abnormal working condition of the steam gland condenser. -cleaning of the rotor that may have generate small additional clearance at some locations.. 2- client accept the plan described in first reply above about loss of ZT.. ras (score: 0.5852)\n",

      "The Turbo compressor TC 02 had a minor inspection on May 2013 where a baroscopic inspection performed to check the internal parts integrity.. The finding are as follow See attached FSR report .. -High fouling deposit on impellers and gas lines.. -Heavy erosion (look to be due by liquid carried over in the process gas) on the leading edge of the impellers blades at the inner diameter.. -High number of FOD on the leading edge of the impellers blades.. -Burnished area on DE side shaft journal completely rough/damaged.. Our GE/NP recommendation as follow ref. to SR90087563: . -Remove the bundle and ship it to Florence workshop for inspection and repair (burnishing, cleaning, NDT,blending if possible of blades, etc.).. -DGS replacement with new ones, as scheduled;. ship the previously installed DGSs to OEM for inspection.. -Remove the inlet temporary strainer as per NIC13.01.. - Open the ASV to check the VECO assembly for its possible clogging, then perform ASV dynamic test (GEFSE and spare parts are required).. -Check suction and discharge KO drums and relevant vane pack. Check gas coolers for possible fouling,. . The customer decision on 2013 was as follow: Major inspection will be scheduled as soon we receive the new bundle on site..

      "Query: On 8th of June 2018 an inspection of the chip detector of C sump was carried out by customer after the alarm (CHPDTCALM) appeared on 5th of June 2018. The result of the inspection was that a big metal piece was founded which looks a part of bearing cage. See photo attached.. After an alarms analysis, was noted that the SUMP B (TGBBTMPALM) and C (TGBCTMPALM) high temperature alarm appeared around of 31st of May 2018. Also, several and intermittent alarms happened due to high synthetic oil vapor separator (L26SQV_1_ALM) sice March 2018.. Please find also attached the MKVIe xml file, which is an historical extract of alarms of the time frame between January 2018 and 11th of June 2018.. The site reports also that are ongoing excavations close the turbine, where a relevant presence of dust probably affects the oil cooler efficiency.. Note that the GG was replaced for similar issues on 19th May 2016, see report attached). The NIC 08.29.SL, was applied before the issues happened. The temperature set points of Sump B and C are as following. Sump B ALM 124 degC, TRIP 135 degC. Sump C ALM 121 degC, TRIP 132 degC.. In addition, the running hours are 40707, starts 698, trips 320.. . On ESN 671-188 (about 37 khours) a chip detector inspection was carried out on June 8th following to C sump detector alarm triggering on June 5th. The pictures shared by FSE confirm the presence of #5R bearing debris on C sump chip detector, most probably a cage pocket. Also some minor debris (pictures not available) have been found on common scavenge magnetic plug and clutch Y strainer.. Scavenge temperature trend collocates the event on June 5th when C sump scavenge temperature overcomes the B sump scavenge before dropping to very low values.. In addition the alarm list shows that also B sump scavenge temperature got multiple times the alarm condition since May 31st.. Based on these evidences ESN 671-188 is deemed unserviceable.. BHGE Engineering recommendation was to ship the gas generator to depot for TDI and main line bearing replacement.. Customer decided to go ahead just with TMF replacement on its responsibility. Investigation on the event not required.. SLO system flushing not performed with the support of SLO analysis results.. Unit is currently in operation.. ESN 671-188 suffered of #5R bearing failure. Unit deemed unserviceable. Customer proceeded to TMF replacement.\n",

      "On 8th of June 2018 an inspection of the chip detector of C sump was carried out by customer after the alarm (CHPDTCALM) appeared on 5th of June 2018. The result of the inspection was that a big metal piece was founded which looks a part of bearing cage. See photo attached.. After an alarms analysis, was noted that the SUMP B (TGBBTMPALM) and C (TGBCTMPALM) high temperature alarm appeared around of 31st of May 2018. Also, several and intermittent alarms happened due to high synthetic oil vapor separator (L26SQV_1_ALM) sice March 2018.. Please find also attached the MKVIe xml file, which is an historical extract of alarms of the time frame between January 2018 and 11th of June 2018.. The site reports also that are ongoing excavations close the turbine, where a relevant presence of dust probably affects the oil cooler efficiency.. Note that the GG was replaced for similar issues on 19th May 2016, see report attached). The NIC 08.29.SL, was applied before the issues happened. The temperature set points of Sump B and C are as following. Sump B ALM 124 degC, TRIP 135 degC. Sump C ALM 121 degC, TRIP 132 degC.. In addition, the running hours are 40707, starts 698, trips 320.. . On ESN 671-188 (about 37 khours) a chip detector inspection was carried out on June 8th following to C sump detector alarm triggering on June 5th. The pictures shared by FSE confirm the presence of #5R bearing debris on C sump chip detector, most probably a cage pocket. Also some minor debris (pictures not available) have been found on common scavenge magnetic plug and clutch Y strainer.. Scavenge temperature trend collocates the event on June 5th when C sump scavenge temperature overcomes the B sump scavenge before dropping to very low values.. In addition the alarm list shows that also B sump scavenge temperature got multiple times the alarm condition since May 31st.. Based on these evidences ESN 671-188 is deemed unserviceable.. BHGE Engineering recommendation was to ship the gas generator to depot for TDI and main line bearing replacement.. Customer decided to go ahead just with TMF replacement on its responsibility. Investigation on the event not required.. SLO system flushing not performed with the support of SLO analysis results.. Unit is currently in operation.. ESN 671-188 suffered of #5R bearing failure. Unit deemed unserviceable. Customer proceeded to TMF replacement. (score: 1.0000)\n",

      "On Dec 29, 2020. GTC2 attempted two times to start at fuel gas but it failed for excess fuel gas at start up (see RM and D notification attached).. This unit was not started at fuel gas from a while since the a second shutoff valve was faulty and it was just replaced.. The fuel gas skid was pressurized and no leaks were found during this replacement activity.. The unit start at liquids fuel and switches to fuel gas with no problem confirming the functionality of the system.. From what we can see, the setpoint K60FGEX is currently set at 825.5 Lb/Hr different from the PI and D where it is set at 720 Lb/Hr.. The timer K4FGEX_OV is set at 1.2 sec.. Most likely this value was tuned during commissioning…but honestly I thought that they would adjust only the timer.. In any case we requested to the RM and D to review the last successful start up at gas (see attached) and seem that the excess fuel value was already really close to the trip setpoint.. The twin unit, GTC1, has a setpoint of 950 Lb/Hr with delay of 1.2 sec.. In order to determinate the correct setpoint I might suggest to perform a fail to ignite test in order to record the value with a fast trend and identify the rush flow and timing at start up.. In order to attempt this test we might need to modify the current Max excess fuel trip value and/or relative time delay.. . (score: 0.5667)\n",

      "During a test,we notice that we can not reach the Crank speed(2200 rpm);. to make progress with the commissioning, we decide to decrease the value of the constant TNK14HM1_RPM from 2200 to 2150 rpm.. Based on the latest results received from Site, we observed that the unit is having troubles in reaching the crank speed. The desired purge speed was barely reached but having always the swash plate at 100%. Several pressure measurements were taken on the circuit to locate the possible source of the issue, after the latest adjustment on the Max Flow the unit was able to reach the crank speed. This seems to indicate there is a lack of flow on the oil circuit that was somehow compensated by the Max Flow adjustment. Investigation shown a fair response of 90HS valve, while there is seems to be a possible leakage from the solenoid 20HS. This point will be checked further using a thermo camera that will be provided from customer. Most likely the issue is on 20HS which we recommend to be replaced as next step. As part of the troubleshooting we recommend to procure also a new 90HS block. Site team requested also gaskets related to filter to be replaced as part of this investigation.

Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. .\n",

Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. . (score: 1.0000)\n",
      "After a major inspection, an HGPI was performed because the performance of the axial compressor were low, during the HGPI they found first stage nozzle wrongly installed, after the HGPI the machine was good and the axial compressor performance as well.. The problem is that customer is observing that the seismic vibration are increasing slowly with time and customer is asking about clarification?. Dear Medhi,. I assume that the vibs behavior of the unit has no changed since the time this SR was opened.. I will close this case.. In case of any update will arise in future please, open a new SR.. Thanks.

      "After a pressurized shutdown is not possible to restart the unit due to missing permissive from antisurge controller (AS1_L3AS_RTS) because during SOP state (around 11-12 BarG) the compressors stages inlet pressure transmitters are out of scale giving a fault to antisurge controller.. Based on IL, SOL47654, the instruments at site should be Honeywell STG840 with a calibration range available of -1Ã·35barg.. We calculated the reference and the expected accuracy in case of calibration span increase to -1Ã·15barg: the reference accuracy would be 9mbar (about 1% of reading in normal operating condition).. On the 8th of August, we recommended to increase the calibration span of the instruments as follow for next start up (both instrument and controller): - PIT5643 from -1 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2640 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2644 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2639from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2641 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2642 from 0 min. to +15 barg.. Site team has already implemented the above mentioned calibration range and tested the AntiSurge controller operation to be smooth at the following startup.. On the 26th of August Site team has communicated \"we tested the modification and it is working fine. we can go ahead for as-built and case closure\". Therefore the above mentioned calibration range modification is confirmed and we can proceed with Field Instrument List SOL49566 as-built issuing..

The twin unit, GTC1, has a setpoint of 950 Lb/Hr with delay of 1.2 sec.. In order to determinate the correct setpoint I might suggest to perform a fail to ignite test in order to record the value with a fast trend and identify the rush flow and timing at start up..

      "Please verify attached email from GE Eng for fuel gas logic modification. QUOTE: . 1) Start-up: the external shut-off valve SDV-415 (FG-3) is opened contemporaneously to the external vent valve BDV-407 (VG-1) closure. However, as soon as the open command is given to SDV-415, some fuel gas is being vented to atmosphere through BDV-407, with a risk to trigger the plant gas detection alarm/trip. BDV-407 takes about 1 second to travel to its fully closed position after command is given. INPEX is asking to introduce a delay of 2 seconds to 3 seconds on the opening of the SDV-415 (after BDV-407 close command is given). Actual delay to be tuned at Site.

NP CENTRIFUGAL COMPRESSOR, EL PALITO REFINERY. Customer needs our FSE assistance on site for around 3 or 4 working days. The unit is under operation but is facing problems with the lub oil system. Local FSE in Venezuela is not available. . More technical details: . Client has been having some issues with a NP centrifugal compressor of the PtR Unit and they have done a lot of things to eliminate those issues but now they need a GE techinician to help them find the correct solution to this matter. . This compressor has a Lube & Seal Oil System, attached the diagrams. The mechanical seals are from EagleBurgman.. This is an overview of the differents troubles they are having. See the diagrams attached as a reference to the comments.. 1. Frequent failures of the mechanical seals. Sometimes this is because of the sudden loss of diferential pressure of the Seal Oil System.. 2. Poor hermeticity of the mechanical seals in the housing because of posible wrong selection of o'rings.. 3. A lot of oil flowing out the mechanical seals. The amount of oil we see in the flow oil glasses located in the drain lines is too much and apparently abnormal. We've checked the mechanical seals faces for excesive wear, craks, etc. and they're most of the times \"OK\". No signs of separation of the faces that could get the oil flowing out them increased.. 4. Sudden lose of Reference and Equalization Gas, then the situation gets into control but sometimes it doesn't and it makes dificult to maintain the system in control.. 5. Lube & Seal Oil System working with the main and auxiliary pump in service at the same time. When we try to get out of service one pump we get the diferential pressure decreased and it can shut down the compressor.. 6. Oil Accumulator Tank doesn't respond as it should.. 7. A lot of instability and poor control of the system valves associated to Lube & Seal Oil System (PDCV, PCVs, etc.).. The problems mentioned above have been in this machine since the 90's, in those years they received the assistance of some NP's technicians, Burgmann's technicians and others and they give some recomendations to eliminate those instability problems. The recomendations that they give were carried out and for several years they didn't have problems but they are having similar problems right now. We've reached the OEM of the mechanical seals to give a response about the design of the MS and some improves wanted to have in order to eliminate some issues but we haven't had any respond..

      "Le client souhaiterait que nous analysions les donnÃ©es vibratoire du compresseur durant le test des 72h et que nous puissions rÃ©pondre Ã ses commentaires. Damien, Abdelaziz, Jeremie,. Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. . (score: 0.4887)\n",

      "RMD received the following email today from the customer following a high vibration trip notification issued to them-. GCM1 experienced radial high vibration trip when we tried to increase load after it reaches the minimum load with compressor speed 70%. Upon further investigation, findings are summarized as follow.. Sub-sync with broadband appeared in the radial bearing (DE,NDE) vibration spectrum indicating process instability. ASV 1 hunting as we tried to increase load. Suction piping between scrubber and compressor experienced high vibration. Upon further investigation, we found flow transmitter FT2411 faulty and giving flow reading even during unit not running. This evening, we managed to replace the transmitter and verified its functionality. As we proceed with start-up, we manage to reach minimum load with low vibration readings and the sub sync signal had disappeared. However, out of sudden CCC triggered Shut Down on Multiple Surges. I believe it is not genuine since thrust bearing temperature very low, radial vibration low, and axial position maintain. Safety On appeared in the alarm list but there was no Surge Count. Simultaneously after GCM1 tripped, all parameter readings at GCM3 HMI turned to zero. This situation happened twice tonight. It seems like there was an interruption in network communication between TCP, CCC, and HMI.. Please see the attached OSM alarm list and trends from the events.. As reported in the SR, customer has solved the issue at site. Basically the CCC calculated the wrong operating point during operation due to the Compressor Instrumentation failure. (Temperature/Pressure/Flow â Compressor Parameters). Due to this reason CCC always initiate \"CCC Multiple Surge\" when it thinks that the compressor work not at the right operating point. After Replacement/Calibration/Range Change for the related instrument, The issue has been solved and the machine currently running with load. . regards. Tommaso. Support has been requested on potential causes for the CCC Surge shutdowns. (score: 0.5282)\n",

      "Seeking advise on ST problem. Good after noon, I am Kraisorn who response in rotating machine maintenance in Bangchak refinery.. We have problem about the steam turbine 4KT-4001.. Now, Governor open about 90% at speed 7,900 rpm. Normally we operate at 8,300 rpm but now can't increase speed to that point.. We check the 1st stage pressure, It has trend to increase since mid of October until now this value is 38 bar (Inlet pressure 40 bar). The turbine NDE axial vibration change from -0.20 mm to -0.02 mm but other vibration are normal.. Could you please advise about this problem and how to check and method to solve this problem . Thank you for your support.. Here below the questions/answers exchanged during the call.. 1 While turbine run at speed around 7,500 rpm, can we introduce the superheat steam (Dry steam) but have margin temp. higher than saturated steam a little bit to washing the turbine ? In order to try washing the turbine the steam has to be saturated. Keeping a temperature in between the operating superheated and the saturated one would be not effective. Moreover, it's strongly not advisable to play with the temperature while the turbine run at high speed, in fact possible water slugs could compromise the machine integrity. The steam may be condensed to wet steam after pass first or second stage and then washing the deposit on the stage after. Can we use this method to washing the turbine ? see above. How much the pressure and temperature that recommend ? see above. What are the concern for this method ? see above. 2 While washing turbine at 500 rpm, steam should be wetted before entrance the turbine that mean wet steam may be condensed before last stage. The washing may not efficient it can cause unbalance or vibration problem after washing or not. As already explained in the very first replies, vibration issues could happen after washing, but they would be not due to washing efficiency. Depending on the thickness and 'hardness' of the deposits, they could be removed not evenly and therefore provoke unbalance. 3 From guide line no. 1-2, Why need to shut down the turbine and cool down casing to 100 C after that start up again to 1,500 rpm. The aim is to induce some thermal transients that should facilitate the deposits detaching (due to the different thermal expansion between steel and deposits). 4 When run turbine at 500 rpm, how to keep compressor run ? Because there are not enough pressure for sealing DGS. If you have not clean external buffer gas, this could be a problem.. 5 Can we remove coupling spacer then washing the turbine during solo run ? Governor valve can control turbine speed at 500 rpm when solo run or not. Usually Yes. 6 If governor valve cannot control speed at 500 rpm. Are there speed allowance for this procedure ? Less than 700 rpm. 7 Are there any detail procedure for wet steam washing ? Please submit to us. How much steam temperature decreasing rate when open BFW valve ? Depends on the plant arrangement. Best practice is always to look for temperature stabilization (about 5 minutes) before to increase the BFW opening.. 8 Please submit the control limit of conductivity (<0.1 mS/cm), SiO2 (< 5 ppm) or etc for BFW. BFW (Boiler Feed Water) properties provided are the ones we specify for a good operation of our steam turbines. What we can say is that the washing will be as much effective as the BFW properties will be closed to the specified. 9 Are there any procedure to clean turbine when turbine stop ? . For example, turbine stop we fill up water inside the turbine and then rotate shaft by turning device to rinse the contaminate and drain out.. Please advise. No. 10 Could you please advise start up step after washing finish ? . Should we stop the turbine to drain out or increase speed to 1,500 rpm and continue warming up ?. Are there need longer warm up than normally start up ?. During the washing, the machine drains shall be kept open (consequent loss of vacuum is not an issue). Once the washing is finished, slightly close the BFW valve and wait for the superheated temperature stabilization. Keep the temperature stable for 5 minutes and then close the drains.. From this point, increase the speed from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. Warm up for 10 minutes @ 1500 rpm and then follow the normal start-up ramps.. 11 Check the schedule of GE supervisor to supervise washing procedure as soon as possible. Joe to provide answer. 12 When washing turbine with 500 rpm, if there are BFW in liquid state go through the turbine. What're the effect for turbine ? . Being the BFW valve Â½\" size, no major water slugs are expected. Moreover, making the washing at 500 rpm limits the risk of damages.. 13 From guide line item 1, Turbine shall cool down to 100 C. Kindly advise where is the position on the casing to measure temperature. Is it TI-530 or use infrared temp to check at casing surface ? OK. 14 Due to our time constrain, Are there any method to cool down the turbine faster than natural cool down ?Can we remove the insulation out to faster cool down ? Absolutely NOT . From your experience, can you advise estimate time for cool down the turbine ? 6-8 hours. 15 Kindly advise essentially concern and caution for startup after turbine washing finish. See point 10.

Also had issues with LED status which we fixed by just rebooting(after we inspected the card for overheating, dust build-up, and bent back-plane pins.. Yesterday afternoon the card finally stopped working. It is not even recognized as being in the rack (error 8325.). We tried cleaning the card, and also swapping the card with one from the PLC in GT1.. see first reply. Assisted FSE in problem resolution (score: 0.4439)\n",

      "Saturday 2nd June at 23:02:40 the Refrigeration steam turbine trip for HH vibration at Journal bearing Drive End (8501VAHH0857X). (see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. . In first analysis I suppose that this TRIP was cause from an issue on PESS (PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC SAFETY SYSTEM) from customer side.. The customer could verify the wiring connection and screw tightening..

So we have concerns about this leakage if the piping breaks. The breakage can directly affect the nozzle and we do not have any nozzle spare.. Gasket has been replaced, water injection tubing line has been replaced together with compression fitting and ferrule. After this no water leakages found. The day after the customer highlighted some leakages between liquid fuel nozzle and main nozzle body, not found during our following inspection on site. There is to consider that scenario is completely different if leakage is present or not and specially if leakages is water or liquid fuel. Is clear that in case of water leakages the main issue is to remove the water from ground floor of baseplate but in case of liquid fuel leakages is completely another story with possible risk of fire event. For this reason we recommend to the customer to check periodically the presence of leakages, and in case of liquid fuel leakages from point indicated (see mail attached), replace the spring C seal item 9 code KFZ293720004..

      "Gorgon CO2 project. Seal gas system. According to SOS9973868 functional description: Very low pressure in the primary vent lines, meaning the secondary gas seal has failed, is detected by transmitters PZ-8035A/B/C (PZLL-8035, 2oo3 voting) and PZ-8041A/B/C (PZLL-8041, 2oo3 voting) and if the relative very low threshold (PZLL-8035 or PZLL8041, 10kPa) are exceeded for more than 10 seconds (continuative), this will result in a compressor trip without vent and related alarm indication.. Can we please ask BHGE Engineering if it is normal to see quite a low pressure in the primary vent of the HP compressors (as read on PZ-8035 and PZ-8041) during pressurized stand-still? . For example, when 3K-1901B tripped this week, with primary vent open to atmosphere and there was 190 kpag in the casing, PZI8541 read 17 kpag and PZI8535 read 13 kpag. This is quite normal values for us to see in the pressurized stand-still case and has the potential to cause us issues on re-starts as the trip setpoint is 10kpag. For the case of 2K-1901B, 319PZI8541 reads 10-11kpag and we have been required to force this when it dipped below 10 kpag for the nitrogen runs. It seems like a very tight margin from the pressures we are seeing in the primary vent to the trip set point. . On the base of provided data, it can be seen that valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 are completely open during pressurized stand-still condition and this fact explain the low pressure (close to trip threshold 10 Kpa) measured on primary vent by PT8034 and PT8038 during pressurized stand-still.. The condition to be forced 100% open for primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 during pressurized stand-still phase is not required (as confirmed by Control System Functional Description SOS9973868 sheet 10/23), so we suggest to remove the above said condition so that primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 will work as per design (regulating their opening in order to keep 1bar upstream themselves) during pressurized stand-still condition..

Several pressure measurements were taken on the circuit to locate the possible source of the issue, after the latest adjustment on the Max Flow the unit was able to reach the crank speed.

Apparenly there is now issue since on PPRA pack are condigured and wired only speed pick-up probes.. In the past this issue came up , the only way to reset it was to switch off the entire G controller and power on again.. Swithing off the individual pack will not solve the issue.. The speed signal seems like working fine , even the PreVote signal are ok.. Unit is running now. Faults is related to PR2 and PR5 as shown an screen-shot attached,. The diagnostics are showing that all three I/O packs are reading a mismatch for 77LC speed pick-ups. It means that between 77LC1 (PR2) and 77LC2 (PR5) there is a difference of 25rpm, even if prevote data are almost aligned. First of all verify if \"dual_difflimit\" is set to 25 by checking in \"PulseRate2\" configuration parameters. After this, my suggestion is to check the wiring correct as per UCP wiring SOM6753639 sh.106 with 77LC1 connected to TREA 45-46 and 77LC2 to 27-28. In the end, I suggest to perform a test by simulating the speed directly on TREA (with frequency generator) and with jumper between PR2 and PR5. If the diagnostic cannot be resetted, the problem probably is on card itself, otherwise there is field issue.. As confirmed by requestor, the case will be closed.

      "On the 5th of June 2019 post the L1 service startup, the Train2 PR2 High Speed Power Turbine (HSPT) vibration readings on the casing accelerometer started trending up close to the trip limit of 25mm/s. The increase in the casing vibration is confirmed to be only on Tr2PR2 and not on other units. Multiple hypotheses exists ranging from residual varnish deposition on HSPT journal bearing 1, restriction in thermal growth, rotor unbalance, rotor-dynamics changes, and bearing 1 damage. The root cause of the casing vibration has not yet been determined. The most likely hypotheses are: 1. Actual mechanical damage on the HSPT bearings.. 2. The effects of MLO DTE-932 and residual varnish on this HSPT bearing 1. . From the current RM&D trend we could see that the vibration on the sesmic probe and the proximeter probes have reduced and the behaviour is consistent with the vibration levels observed prior to oil replacement activity during L1. Oil varnish is considered to be a contributing factor for the vibration spike. . With the above finding there is no requirement to increase the sesmic vibration limit from 25 mm/sec to 35 mm/sec, further after discussion with level 3 the sesmic vibration setpoint increase from 25mm/sec to 35mm/sec cannot be approved as this affects the HSPT integrity.

The twin unit, GTC1, has a setpoint of 950 Lb/Hr with delay of 1.2 sec.. In order to determinate the correct setpoint I might suggest to perform a fail to ignite test in order to record the value with a fast trend and identify the rush flow and timing at start up..

Also marshaling panels side terminals, Genius IO card terminals and termination board terminals are found intact without looseness. So, restarted the unit immediately.. On 01-sep-2015, CS06 Unit-B went to shutdown again in an hour due to the same IO fault (ZSL-707A). The input signal is connected to redundant DI modules GB1-1 and GB1-3 at channel-12. Suspected the problem might be with GB1-1 or GB1-3. So replaced the GB1-1 only with a new spare DI module.. On 02-sep-2015, CS06 Unit-B restarted at 12:00 hrs and again went to shutdown at 19:20 hrs due to 11 IO faults. All 11 IOs belong to the same redundant DI module GB1-1 and GB1-3 and these are configured as Tri-state inputs. Observed the OK status led is flashing on both DI modules at the time of fault..

      "-----------------------------. FROM ATTACHED CUSTOMER EMAIL (TRANSLATED FROM ITALIAN): . The compressor has shut down due to high vibrations, test slide on cylinder 1st phase called 1B. The cause is probably due to the loosening of the handwheel for operating the additional harmful space adjustment system (Design No. SNO 34722). The leaflet appears dirty with oil and also the chamber of the screw appears full of oil with gas presence. The handwheel (POS. 24) with the compressor running shone clearly for a few days.. The harmful space is normally excluded, we need to restart the machine urgently, we therefore require a solution immediately for the elimination of this adjustment device..

GCM1 experienced radial high vibration trip when we tried to increase load after it reaches the minimum load with compressor speed 70%. Upon further investigation, findings are summarized as follow.. Sub-sync with broadband appeared in the radial bearing (DE,NDE) vibration spectrum indicating process instability. ASV 1 hunting as we tried to increase load. Suction piping between scrubber and compressor experienced high vibration. Upon further investigation, we found flow transmitter FT2411 faulty and giving flow reading even during unit not running. This evening, we managed to replace the transmitter and verified its functionality. As we proceed with start-up, we manage to reach minimum load with low vibration readings and the sub sync signal had disappeared. However, out of sudden CCC triggered Shut Down on Multiple Surges. I believe it is not genuine since thrust bearing temperature very low, radial vibration low, and axial position maintain. Safety On appeared in the alarm list but there was no Surge Count. Simultaneously after GCM1 tripped, all parameter readings at GCM3 HMI turned to zero. This situation happened twice tonight. It seems like there was an interruption in network communication between TCP, CCC, and HMI.. Please see the attached OSM alarm list and trends from the events.. As reported in the SR, customer has solved the issue at site. Basically the CCC calculated the wrong operating point during operation due to the Compressor Instrumentation failure. (Temperature/Pressure/Flow â Compressor Parameters). Due to this reason CCC always initiate \"CCC Multiple Surge\" when it thinks that the compressor work not at the right operating point.

      "During startup, following alarm always annunciated: 15-PAF-2213 (FLT) AXIAL COMPR. DISCHARGE. Currently, all 3 similar units are having this problem.. In 13th May 2014 during opportunity shutdown, following investigations was carried out:- o Verification of transmitter output with actual pressure pumping found good and linear to MkVe.. o Tubing line was blown/purge and found water accumulation in it.. o Tubing line Pressure Test utilizing Inst Air discovered 2 fitting connection points leaking : retightened and re-test resulted in good holding pressure within ~2 mins. Hi Asfa Nizam,. We analysed the logic and this works correctly. This alarm is necessary because it is an input of the \"Temperature Control Reference (TTRXV5)\" block which safeguards the unit integrity in case the 15PT1213 does not work correctly.. We analysed the trend attached to the case and trends supplied by R&MD to understand axial compressor behaviour during restart phase.. We advise to change it from 58.1 to 30 the value of constant CAKCPD.. We suggest evaluating the opportunity to apply NIC 08.10.. Regards. Andrea. See Technical Solution (score: 0.5010)\n",

Item 406-416: a corner needs to be cut and shaped due interference with auxiliary enclosure panel; it has not been considered that these items are fixed on the inlet plenum, that is 1595 mm width, whereas these items are 1646 mm â pictures 2-3.. Due interference, the 4 lifting lugs on the Inlet Externsors need to be cut and removed â picture 4.. Solution proposed by the site team below recap: 1 â to adapt the plates P/N 406, 416 to the real dimensions of both AUXILIARY and GT ENCLOSURES panels;. 2 - to cut the lifting lugs provided on the extensions of the INLET PLENUM to allow the installation of the items P/N 401, 411. Can be considered acceptable.. Case opened to highlight some issues on the INLET PLENUM NOISE REDUCTION PANELS â refer to SOM6622557.. According to the site team, it seems that: 1 â the drawing SOM6622557 does not take in count the presence of a door on the GT ON-BASE ENCLOSURE â refer to the drawing SOM6673878, sheet 1, view from B;. 2 â the drawing SOM6622557 does not take in count the presence of 4 lifting lugs on the extension of INLET PLENUM;. Imputation is assigned to ENG because the BHGE document SOM5457767 â TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION FOR MS 5002D GAS TURBINE ENCLOSURE GT COMPARTMENT recalls the following document SMO0683075 for the INLET PLENUM.. The drawing SMO0683075 does not mentions the presence of extensions for INLET PLENUM.. In my opinion, ENG should issue a dedicated specification for the GT ENCLOSURE mentioning the correct specification SMO0683074 also listed into the global BOM. (score: 0.5196)\n",

      "On the 5th of June 2019 post the L1 service startup, the Train2 PR2 High Speed Power Turbine (HSPT) vibration readings on the casing accelerometer started trending up close to the trip limit of 25mm/s. The increase in the casing vibration is confirmed to be only on Tr2PR2 and not on other units. Multiple hypotheses exists ranging from residual varnish deposition on HSPT journal bearing 1, restriction in thermal growth, rotor unbalance, rotor-dynamics changes, and bearing 1 damage. The root cause of the casing vibration has not yet been determined. The most likely hypotheses are: 1. Actual mechanical damage on the HSPT bearings.. 2. The effects of MLO DTE-932 and residual varnish on this HSPT bearing 1. . From the current RM&D trend we could see that the vibration on the sesmic probe and the proximeter probes have reduced and the behaviour is consistent with the vibration levels observed prior to oil replacement activity during L1. Oil varnish is considered to be a contributing factor for the vibration spike. . With the above finding there is no requirement to increase the sesmic vibration limit from 25 mm/sec to 35 mm/sec, further after discussion with level 3 the sesmic vibration setpoint increase from 25mm/sec to 35mm/sec cannot be approved as this affects the HSPT integrity.

      "Saturday 2nd June at 23:02:40 the Refrigeration steam turbine trip for HH vibration at Journal bearing Drive End (8501VAHH0857X). (see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. .

What is the impact of running the GT after DLN tuning using different fuel gas (only emissions or other concerns) ? . GE confirmed no further tuning is required in case of fuel gas within +/-5% of MWI from tuning gas. To reply to above query to consider following two situation . a) Within +/-5% MWI . b) Outside of +/- 5% MWI . 2. Whether or not the following sequence is acceptable: . a) 1st Tuning of GTGx, GTGx can go Pre-Mix . b) Copy parameters from GTGx and copy to GTGy. GTGy can go to Pre-Mix . c) Both GTGx and GTGy to undergo 2nd Tuning once final fuel gas is available . . 1. What is the impact of running the GT after DLN tuning using different fuel gas (only emissions or other concerns) ? DLN tuning is not required if new fuel gas is within +/-5% of MWI from tuning gas.. In case of MWI difference greater than +/-5% DLN tuning is needed for avoiding any risk of high emission/combustion dynamics.. 2.

Once the unit is started up and the Aux LO pump turns off, the system maintains the pressure on the header at ~1.8 barg temporary, then it gradually drops and in a couple of hours of operation the aux LO pump is triggered back on. The customer reported the following conditions: 1. the discharge pressure of the main LO pump gradually increases up to 12.8 barg as the header pressure drops. 2. a LO leakage is observed in the back plate of the main lube oil pump (~30 drops/min) . 3. the VPR-1 is opened ~20% vs. 50% previously observed in normal conditions. 4. the replacement of the VR-1 with the VR-1 removed from Train A (currently under scheduled maintenance) did not sort out the problem (the LO system had exactly the same behavior). 5. the LO header temperature is ~60 degC and did not dropped even when the customer switched to a new cooler (in previous occasions it was observed that the new cooler was able to drop the LO temperature to 55 degC).. The customer is in progress to replace the VPR-1 and the main LO pump with those installed in Train A (no spares available on the platform)..

      "Manitowoc Public Utilities Frame 5 CT Issues. Background: The unit was last successfully started and run on 1/10 for a short run to test a new auto synchronizing relay. Temperatures were typical for Wisconsin at the time (25-30 degrees). Yesterday (1/30), we were requested to start our CT and be online at around 0500. Temperatures were about minus 20 degrees with blowing snow. We also had a significant snow fall on Monday (12+ inches) with major blowing and drifting. So that is the background for our start.. We started the unit on NG around 0500 in the morning and synched onto the grid. After our normal 10 minute warm up period at 2 MW load was increased to ~11.5 MW. The unit appeared to be stable and running at ~11.5 MW for just over 1/2 hour when it tripped. Unfortunately the exact cause is now a bit hard to determine as our control PLC is not logging alarm history (a separate issue we are looking into). While it was all happening, I ended up hitting a reset, thinking I could go back to the alarm history, but the history is not there. There were a number of alarms and I know at least one Shutdown alarm was OVERSPEED TRIP. However, we did not see indication that speed got that high (108%). If it did it was very short.. After the unit rolled down and became ready for a restart, we attempted a 2nd start. At about 60% speed the unit tripped on High Vibration of the #2 Turbine Bearing (Trips at 1 in/sec. velocity). The vibrations are definitely real, as we could feel it on the startup. We suspected the trip from load with the extreme cold temperatures could have caused a bow in the shaft. We left the unit on the jack for about 7 hours. We were again asked to run and attempted another start around 1400. This time the unit tripped on High Exhaust Gas Temp and High Vibration at the same time. Vibration has typically not been an issue with this unit, and we are at a loss as to the cause of the High EGT.. Finally, for some additional information, we looked at the trends from the initial run and trip and can see there were 4 or 5 instances of significant MW load spikes (2+ MW swings in very short time frame). These swings corresponds with spikes in the Inter-Stage Gas Pressure. I believe that the NG header pressure regulator was sticking, causing spikes in the supply header pressure as the unit was running. These spikes resulted in sudden power surges in the turbine, which ultimately lead to the trip. Assesment provided based on the GE philosophy of control and not based on how the 3rd party control panel operates. Borescope inspection is recommended. No changes on control system is recommended at this time as this is not a GE supplied control system.. . Potential turbine parts failure.

The amount of oil we see in the flow oil glasses located in the drain lines is too much and apparently abnormal. We've checked the mechanical seals faces for excesive wear, craks, etc. and they're most of the times \"OK\". No signs of separation of the faces that could get the oil flowing out them increased.. 4. Sudden lose of Reference and Equalization Gas, then the situation gets into control but sometimes it doesn't and it makes dificult to maintain the system in control.. 5. Lube & Seal Oil System working with the main and auxiliary pump in service at the same time. When we try to get out of service one pump we get the diferential pressure decreased and it can shut down the compressor.. 6. Oil Accumulator Tank doesn't respond as it should.. 7. A lot of instability and poor control of the system valves associated to Lube & Seal Oil System (PDCV, PCVs, etc.).. The problems mentioned above have been in this machine since the 90's, in those years they received the assistance of some NP's technicians, Burgmann's technicians and others and they give some recomendations to eliminate those instability problems. The recomendations that they give were carried out and for several years they didn't have problems but they are having similar problems right now.

      "Seeking advise on ST problem. Good after noon, I am Kraisorn who response in rotating machine maintenance in Bangchak refinery.. We have problem about the steam turbine 4KT-4001.. Now, Governor open about 90% at speed 7,900 rpm. Normally we operate at 8,300 rpm but now can't increase speed to that point.. We check the 1st stage pressure, It has trend to increase since mid of October until now this value is 38 bar (Inlet pressure 40 bar). The turbine NDE axial vibration change from -0.20 mm to -0.02 mm but other vibration are normal.. Could you please advise about this problem and how to check and method to solve this problem . Thank you for your support.. Here below the questions/answers exchanged during the call.. 1 While turbine run at speed around 7,500 rpm, can we introduce the superheat steam (Dry steam) but have margin temp. higher than saturated steam a little bit to washing the turbine ? In order to try washing the turbine the steam has to be saturated. Keeping a temperature in between the operating superheated and the saturated one would be not effective. Moreover, it's strongly not advisable to play with the temperature while the turbine run at high speed, in fact possible water slugs could compromise the machine integrity. The steam may be condensed to wet steam after pass first or second stage and then washing the deposit on the stage after. Can we use this method to washing the turbine ? see above. How much the pressure and temperature that recommend ? see above. What are the concern for this method ? see above. 2 While washing turbine at 500 rpm, steam should be wetted before entrance the turbine that mean wet steam may be condensed before last stage. The washing may not efficient it can cause unbalance or vibration problem after washing or not. As already explained in the very first replies, vibration issues could happen after washing, but they would be not due to washing efficiency. Depending on the thickness and 'hardness' of the deposits, they could be removed not evenly and therefore provoke unbalance. 3 From guide line no. 1-2, Why need to shut down the turbine and cool down casing to 100 C after that start up again to 1,500 rpm. The aim is to induce some thermal transients that should facilitate the deposits detaching (due to the different thermal expansion between steel and deposits). 4 When run turbine at 500 rpm, how to keep compressor run ? Because there are not enough pressure for sealing DGS. If you have not clean external buffer gas, this could be a problem.. 5 Can we remove coupling spacer then washing the turbine during solo run ? Governor valve can control turbine speed at 500 rpm when solo run or not. Usually Yes. 6 If governor valve cannot control speed at 500 rpm. Are there speed allowance for this procedure ? Less than 700 rpm. 7 Are there any detail procedure for wet steam washing ? Please submit to us. How much steam temperature decreasing rate when open BFW valve ? Depends on the plant arrangement. Best practice is always to look for temperature stabilization (about 5 minutes) before to increase the BFW opening.. 8 Please submit the control limit of conductivity (<0.1 mS/cm), SiO2 (< 5 ppm) or etc for BFW. BFW (Boiler Feed Water) properties provided are the ones we specify for a good operation of our steam turbines. What we can say is that the washing will be as much effective as the BFW properties will be closed to the specified. 9 Are there any procedure to clean turbine when turbine stop ? . For example, turbine stop we fill up water inside the turbine and then rotate shaft by turning device to rinse the contaminate and drain out.. Please advise. No. 10 Could you please advise start up step after washing finish ? . Should we stop the turbine to drain out or increase speed to 1,500 rpm and continue warming up ?. Are there need longer warm up than normally start up ?. During the washing, the machine drains shall be kept open (consequent loss of vacuum is not an issue). Once the washing is finished, slightly close the BFW valve and wait for the superheated temperature stabilization. Keep the temperature stable for 5 minutes and then close the drains.. From this point, increase the speed from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. Warm up for 10 minutes @ 1500 rpm and then follow the normal start-up ramps.. 11 Check the schedule of GE supervisor to supervise washing procedure as soon as possible. Joe to provide answer. 12 When washing turbine with 500 rpm, if there are BFW in liquid state go through the turbine. What're the effect for turbine ? . Being the BFW valve Â½\" size, no major water slugs are expected. Moreover, making the washing at 500 rpm limits the risk of damages.. 13 From guide line item 1, Turbine shall cool down to 100 C. Kindly advise where is the position on the casing to measure temperature. Is it TI-530 or use infrared temp to check at casing surface ? OK. 14 Due to our time constrain, Are there any method to cool down the turbine faster than natural cool down ?Can we remove the insulation out to faster cool down ? Absolutely NOT . From your experience, can you advise estimate time for cool down the turbine ? 6-8 hours. 15 Kindly advise essentially concern and caution for startup after turbine washing finish. See point 10.

      "Dear Luis,. If I correctly understood, you are going to replace both HPT and LPT on PK-172 unit. If it is correct, I would proceed as follows: . 1 - I would close this SR 90368181.. 2 - Once the new HPT and LPT will be installed at site, I would collect running parameters of the new unit and I would upload them in a new SR ( linked to old SR 90368181) , asking for a comment on new recorded data. This findings, depending on HPTs speed lack still there or that, will reveal if the problem was addressable to something outside module ( Anti Surge Valve, VSV schedule by UCP) or to the module itself.. 3 - If the problem wont be resolved by module swap, it will be sufficient the new SR above, as we will have to focus on something still at site and not related to engine. On the opposite, if the problem will be fixed, it will be necessary a second new SR, to define a dedicated checklist to inspect the modules ( HPT and LPT) at the workshop to try to detect what causes the poor HPT speed.. If it is fine to you, I would invite you to proceed as above.. Thanks. Riccardo. Hi Rene,. as requested I am going to close this SR; looking forward to future update in a new SR.. Regards. Ciao.

      "Saturday 2nd June at 23:02:40 the Refrigeration steam turbine trip for HH vibration at Journal bearing Drive End (8501VAHH0857X). (see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. .

Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. . (score is 0.4778)\n"

Client has been having some issues with a NP centrifugal compressor of the PtR Unit and they have done a lot of things to eliminate those issues but now they need a GE techinician to help them find the correct solution to this matter. . This compressor has a Lube & Seal Oil System, attached the diagrams. The mechanical seals are from EagleBurgman.. This is an overview of the differents troubles they are having. See the diagrams attached as a reference to the comments.. 1. Frequent failures of the mechanical seals. Sometimes this is because of the sudden loss of diferential pressure of the Seal Oil System.. 2. Poor hermeticity of the mechanical seals in the housing because of posible wrong selection of o'rings.. 3. A lot of oil flowing out the mechanical seals. The amount of oil we see in the flow oil glasses located in the drain lines is too much and apparently abnormal. We've checked the mechanical seals faces for excesive wear, craks, etc. and they're most of the times \"OK\". No signs of separation of the faces that could get the oil flowing out them increased.. 4. Sudden lose of Reference and Equalization Gas, then the situation gets into control but sometimes it doesn't and it makes dificult to maintain the system in control.. 5. Lube & Seal Oil System working with the main and auxiliary pump in service at the same time. When we try to get out of service one pump we get the diferential pressure decreased and it can shut down the compressor.. 6. Oil Accumulator Tank doesn't respond as it should.. 7. A lot of instability and poor control of the system valves associated to Lube & Seal Oil System (PDCV, PCVs, etc.).. The problems mentioned above have been in this machine since the 90's, in those years they received the assistance of some NP's technicians, Burgmann's technicians and others and they give some recomendations to eliminate those instability problems. The recomendations that they give were carried out and for several years they didn't have problems but they are having similar problems right now.

To do it, we need force manually the software AO- a20rcy2 from 0% up to 70 % and keep temperature below 50 Â°C.. No Popup is available â¦at the moment the only way to adj it, is force from the SW. Pls for more detail refere to the e-mail attached to the case: VSP - 23TV0410_A --_ a20rcy2 TY-0410_A ( ) TEMPERATURE CONTROL VALVE POSITIONER TRANSMITTER.msg. After involving the process operability team, we confirm that the valve in subject must be operated always in manual. The purpose is to heat up the suction to avoid hydrates formation. The valve must be kept fully open under all operating conditions.. With this approach the most critical scenario is when the AS is open. In this case if the temperature on TT-0401 will increase to a high value the position of the valve shall be reduced from 100% full open to a lower percentage with 5% steps (value to be determined at Site during running tests). Once the best value will be found, the valve will be maintained in manual. Not automatic operation is allowed. To facilitate the operation we can add a valve control object on process page \"COMMON_TAPIDC00.CIM\" to be configured as per the attached file.

      "Saturday 2nd June at 23:02:40 the Refrigeration steam turbine trip for HH vibration at Journal bearing Drive End (8501VAHH0857X). (see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. . In first analysis I suppose that this TRIP was cause from an issue on PESS (PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC SAFETY SYSTEM) from customer side..

Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. . (score is 0.4642)\n",

      "On PAB platform is operating a unit not covered by our CSA contract: however the client is asking help on following issue, please refer below description. Attached you can find formal request came by client with m6b attached. Quote. we are having some issues with our Booster Compressor K0401-01. The recycle valve is opening to values of 80-90% and it is apparently due to the detection of surge, therefore the surge control logic increases the setpoint of the controller forcing it to open faster. We havent been able to find process reasons for such a sudden change, but when looking at it closer our Rotating Equipment engineer has determined that the compressor is operating at incipient surge region, meaning that the Surge Control Line (SCL) is actually at the incipient surge region.. Unquote. . See attached mail customer agree to close the SR because they are going to shutdown the unit for UCP upgrade. But I still suggest to record the issue, keep the following information to the control requisition engineer in this upgrade in order to anticipate issue in future.. ----------------------------------. According to Walter's statement, if it is a sudden open instead of steady open, most likely the 'transient absorption' is ON. This is a designed regulation/protection, as a feature of anti-surge controller. Usually it be activated when process condition change ratio exceed a certain threshold. For example, fluctuation on flow measurement. If it is a steady open, it means operation point is approaching to SCL.. However, in order to help customer evaluate this 'transient absorption' activation event, we still need to start with data analysis. Please get the required data.. The possibilities will include but not limited to: . - A real process fluctuation. - A slight process fluctuation with a too sensitive detection parameter tuned. - A instrumentation / cabling issue which introduce noise in loop. - A steady operation with insufficient suction flow. About raised questions by customer: . Q1.Can we operate the KT-0401 in the long term with 40% (once in a while -95%) open recycle valves?. A: as for equipment itself, there is no issue. However, it is of energy waste. If ASV staying stable at 40%, that usually means there is not enough suction flow to feed compressor at that speed (if suction and discharge pressure ratio is to be maintained). Customer may consider lower compressor speed manually or regulated by process controller. After we receive the data, we can have more precise evaluation. . Q2.We may have to adjust the SCL even more to the right? Or have a study carried out how to modify the unit?. A: If the suction condition ( including suction temperature, pressure, gas molecular weight is not far away from designed condition, there is no need to shift SCL in general, unless the set SCL has issue which may be seen from data analysis and other check on e.g flow element sheet. This can be discuss later.. customer request for technical support. (score is 0.5881)\n",

The operating conditions are also same as before. we reviewed the clearance record from site and we had comments and found 2 factors that may explain the excessive leaks compared to design (attached powerpoint presentation). After discussion with the FSE, the measurement were the same at dissassembly and reassembly. There did not replace the seals as they were in good condition. Due to short outage timing, discrepencies observed were noted in the report and shall be taken into account for preparation of next major overhaul (fixed seals damaged (radial - axial), removed, diaphrams damaged).. The difference of leak before and after outage of 40 kg/h described by client could therefore be explained : . -potential abnormal working condition of the steam gland condenser. -cleaning of the rotor that may have generate small additional clearance at some locations.. 2- client accept the plan described in first reply above about loss of ZT.. ras (score is 0.5852)\n",

After involving the process operability team, we confirm that the valve in subject must be operated always in manual. The purpose is to heat up the suction to avoid hydrates formation. The valve must be kept fully open under all operating conditions.. With this approach the most critical scenario is when the AS is open. In this case if the temperature on TT-0401 will increase to a high value the position of the valve shall be reduced from 100% full open to a lower percentage with 5% steps (value to be determined at Site during running tests). Once the best value will be found, the valve will be maintained in manual. Not automatic operation is allowed.

According to SOS9973868 functional description: Very low pressure in the primary vent lines, meaning the secondary gas seal has failed, is detected by transmitters PZ-8035A/B/C (PZLL-8035, 2oo3 voting) and PZ-8041A/B/C (PZLL-8041, 2oo3 voting) and if the relative very low threshold (PZLL-8035 or PZLL8041, 10kPa) are exceeded for more than 10 seconds (continuative), this will result in a compressor trip without vent and related alarm indication.. Can we please ask BHGE Engineering if it is normal to see quite a low pressure in the primary vent of the HP compressors (as read on PZ-8035 and PZ-8041) during pressurized stand-still? . For example, when 3K-1901B tripped this week, with primary vent open to atmosphere and there was 190 kpag in the casing, PZI8541 read 17 kpag and PZI8535 read 13 kpag. This is quite normal values for us to see in the pressurized stand-still case and has the potential to cause us issues on re-starts as the trip setpoint is 10kpag. For the case of 2K-1901B, 319PZI8541 reads 10-11kpag and we have been required to force this when it dipped below 10 kpag for the nitrogen runs. It seems like a very tight margin from the pressures we are seeing in the primary vent to the trip set point. . On the base of provided data, it can be seen that valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 are completely open during pressurized stand-still condition and this fact explain the low pressure (close to trip threshold 10 Kpa) measured on primary vent by PT8034 and PT8038 during pressurized stand-still.. The condition to be forced 100% open for primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 during pressurized stand-still phase is not required (as confirmed by Control System Functional Description SOS9973868 sheet 10/23), so we suggest to remove the above said condition so that primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 will work as per design (regulating their opening in order to keep 1bar upstream themselves) during pressurized stand-still condition..

The result of the inspection was that a big metal piece was founded which looks a part of bearing cage. See photo attached.. After an alarms analysis, was noted that the SUMP B (TGBBTMPALM) and C (TGBCTMPALM) high temperature alarm appeared around of 31st of May 2018. Also, several and intermittent alarms happened due to high synthetic oil vapor separator (L26SQV_1_ALM) sice March 2018.. Please find also attached the MKVIe xml file, which is an historical extract of alarms of the time frame between January 2018 and 11th of June 2018.. The site reports also that are ongoing excavations close the turbine, where a relevant presence of dust probably affects the oil cooler efficiency.. Note that the GG was replaced for similar issues on 19th May 2016, see report attached). The NIC 08.29.SL, was applied before the issues happened. The temperature set points of Sump B and C are as following. Sump B ALM 124 degC, TRIP 135 degC. Sump C ALM 121 degC, TRIP 132 degC.. In addition, the running hours are 40707, starts 698, trips 320.. . On ESN 671-188 (about 37 khours) a chip detector inspection was carried out on June 8th following to C sump detector alarm triggering on June 5th. The pictures shared by FSE confirm the presence of #5R bearing debris on C sump chip detector, most probably a cage pocket. Also some minor debris (pictures not available) have been found on common scavenge magnetic plug and clutch Y strainer.. Scavenge temperature trend collocates the event on June 5th when C sump scavenge temperature overcomes the B sump scavenge before dropping to very low values.. In addition the alarm list shows that also B sump scavenge temperature got multiple times the alarm condition since May 31st.. Based on these evidences ESN 671-188 is deemed unserviceable.. BHGE Engineering recommendation was to ship the gas generator to depot for TDI and main line bearing replacement.. Customer decided to go ahead just with TMF replacement on its responsibility. Investigation on the event not required.. SLO system flushing not performed with the support of SLO analysis results.. Unit is currently in operation.. ESN 671-188 suffered of #5R bearing failure.

During this phase is visible a synthetic oil leak from axial compressor stator blade (visible oil on the linkage in the attached picture) all around the machine.. We do not have past experiences on the LM6000.. Similar case happened on LM2500 was due to not enough seal air on the sump during the crank..

Based on the latest results received from Site, we observed that the unit is having troubles in reaching the crank speed. The desired purge speed was barely reached but having always the swash plate at 100%. Several pressure measurements were taken on the circuit to locate the possible source of the issue, after the latest adjustment on the Max Flow the unit was able to reach the crank speed. This seems to indicate there is a lack of flow on the oil circuit that was somehow compensated by the Max Flow adjustment. Investigation shown a fair response of 90HS valve, while there is seems to be a possible leakage from the solenoid 20HS. This point will be checked further using a thermo camera that will be provided from customer. Most likely the issue is on 20HS which we recommend to be replaced as next step.

It is different for the fixed point for thermal expansion. Those need to be set as per drawing requirement prior to start the unit. It is anyway a deviation from our standard so we suggest IM to send a disclaimer letter to Customer.. (score is 0.5397)\n",

      "Le client souhaiterait que nous analysions les donnÃ©es vibratoire du compresseur durant le test des 72h et que nous puissions rÃ©pondre Ã ses commentaires. Damien, Abdelaziz, Jeremie,. Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. . (score is 1.0000)\n",

Please urgently provide us with the remedial actions to put in place in order to restore the safe and reliable conditions of the machine run.. Looking forward your urgent reply I ask you to dedicate to Sper the due attention as per the Contract in place and the Client history. 1- excessive steam leakage: according to client answers (attached), the flow is measured (and increase of temperature in the flash tank), so there are no doubt about increase in flow. The operating conditions are also same as before. we reviewed the clearance record from site and we had comments and found 2 factors that may explain the excessive leaks compared to design (attached powerpoint presentation). After discussion with the FSE, the measurement were the same at dissassembly and reassembly. There did not replace the seals as they were in good condition. Due to short outage timing, discrepencies observed were noted in the report and shall be taken into account for preparation of next major overhaul (fixed seals damaged (radial - axial), removed, diaphrams damaged).. The difference of leak before and after outage of 40 kg/h described by client could therefore be explained : . -potential abnormal working condition of the steam gland condenser. -cleaning of the rotor that may have generate small additional clearance at some locations.. 2- client accept the plan described in first reply above about loss of ZT.. ras (score is 1.0000)\n",

Local FSE in Venezuela is not available. . More technical details: . Client has been having some issues with a NP centrifugal compressor of the PtR Unit and they have done a lot of things to eliminate those issues but now they need a GE techinician to help them find the correct solution to this matter. . This compressor has a Lube & Seal Oil System, attached the diagrams. The mechanical seals are from EagleBurgman.. This is an overview of the differents troubles they are having. See the diagrams attached as a reference to the comments.. 1. Frequent failures of the mechanical seals. Sometimes this is because of the sudden loss of diferential pressure of the Seal Oil System.. 2. Poor hermeticity of the mechanical seals in the housing because of posible wrong selection of o'rings.. 3. A lot of oil flowing out the mechanical seals. The amount of oil we see in the flow oil glasses located in the drain lines is too much and apparently abnormal. We've checked the mechanical seals faces for excesive wear, craks, etc. and they're most of the times \"OK\". No signs of separation of the faces that could get the oil flowing out them increased.. 4. Sudden lose of Reference and Equalization Gas, then the situation gets into control but sometimes it doesn't and it makes dificult to maintain the system in control.. 5. Lube & Seal Oil System working with the main and auxiliary pump in service at the same time. When we try to get out of service one pump we get the diferential pressure decreased and it can shut down the compressor.. 6. Oil Accumulator Tank doesn't respond as it should.. 7. A lot of instability and poor control of the system valves associated to Lube & Seal Oil System (PDCV, PCVs, etc.).. The problems mentioned above have been in this machine since the 90's, in those years they received the assistance of some NP's technicians, Burgmann's technicians and others and they give some recomendations to eliminate those instability problems. The recomendations that they give were carried out and for several years they didn't have problems but they are having similar problems right now. We've reached the OEM of the mechanical seals to give a response about the design of the MS and some improves wanted to have in order to eliminate some issues but we haven't had any respond..

Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â¢ gas composition. â¢ suction temperature. â¢ suction pressure. â¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. . (score is 0.4887)\n",

Sub-sync with broadband appeared in the radial bearing (DE,NDE) vibration spectrum indicating process instability. ASV 1 hunting as we tried to increase load. Suction piping between scrubber and compressor experienced high vibration. Upon further investigation, we found flow transmitter FT2411 faulty and giving flow reading even during unit not running. This evening, we managed to replace the transmitter and verified its functionality. As we proceed with start-up, we manage to reach minimum load with low vibration readings and the sub sync signal had disappeared. However, out of sudden CCC triggered Shut Down on Multiple Surges. I believe it is not genuine since thrust bearing temperature very low, radial vibration low, and axial position maintain. Safety On appeared in the alarm list but there was no Surge Count. Simultaneously after GCM1 tripped, all parameter readings at GCM3 HMI turned to zero. This situation happened twice tonight. It seems like there was an interruption in network communication between TCP, CCC, and HMI.. Please see the attached OSM alarm list and trends from the events.. As reported in the SR, customer has solved the issue at site. Basically the CCC calculated the wrong operating point during operation due to the Compressor Instrumentation failure. (Temperature/Pressure/Flow â Compressor Parameters). Due to this reason CCC always initiate \"CCC Multiple Surge\" when it thinks that the compressor work not at the right operating point.

Now, Governor open about 90% at speed 7,900 rpm. Normally we operate at 8,300 rpm but now can't increase speed to that point.. We check the 1st stage pressure, It has trend to increase since mid of October until now this value is 38 bar (Inlet pressure 40 bar). The turbine NDE axial vibration change from -0.20 mm to -0.02 mm but other vibration are normal.. Could you please advise about this problem and how to check and method to solve this problem . Thank you for your support.. Here below the questions/answers exchanged during the call.. 1 While turbine run at speed around 7,500 rpm, can we introduce the superheat steam (Dry steam) but have margin temp. higher than saturated steam a little bit to washing the turbine ? In order to try washing the turbine the steam has to be saturated. Keeping a temperature in between the operating superheated and the saturated one would be not effective. Moreover, it's strongly not advisable to play with the temperature while the turbine run at high speed, in fact possible water slugs could compromise the machine integrity. The steam may be condensed to wet steam after pass first or second stage and then washing the deposit on the stage after. Can we use this method to washing the turbine ? see above. How much the pressure and temperature that recommend ? see above. What are the concern for this method ? see above. 2 While washing turbine at 500 rpm, steam should be wetted before entrance the turbine that mean wet steam may be condensed before last stage. The washing may not efficient it can cause unbalance or vibration problem after washing or not. As already explained in the very first replies, vibration issues could happen after washing, but they would be not due to washing efficiency. Depending on the thickness and 'hardness' of the deposits, they could be removed not evenly and therefore provoke unbalance. 3 From guide line no. 1-2, Why need to shut down the turbine and cool down casing to 100 C after that start up again to 1,500 rpm. The aim is to induce some thermal transients that should facilitate the deposits detaching (due to the different thermal expansion between steel and deposits). 4 When run turbine at 500 rpm, how to keep compressor run ? Because there are not enough pressure for sealing DGS. If you have not clean external buffer gas, this could be a problem.. 5 Can we remove coupling spacer then washing the turbine during solo run ? Governor valve can control turbine speed at 500 rpm when solo run or not. Usually Yes. 6 If governor valve cannot control speed at 500 rpm. Are there speed allowance for this procedure ? Less than 700 rpm. 7 Are there any detail procedure for wet steam washing ? Please submit to us. How much steam temperature decreasing rate when open BFW valve ? Depends on the plant arrangement. Best practice is always to look for temperature stabilization (about 5 minutes) before to increase the BFW opening.. 8 Please submit the control limit of conductivity (<0.1 mS/cm), SiO2 (< 5 ppm) or etc for BFW. BFW (Boiler Feed Water) properties provided are the ones we specify for a good operation of our steam turbines. What we can say is that the washing will be as much effective as the BFW properties will be closed to the specified. 9 Are there any procedure to clean turbine when turbine stop ? . For example, turbine stop we fill up water inside the turbine and then rotate shaft by turning device to rinse the contaminate and drain out.. Please advise. No. 10 Could you please advise start up step after washing finish ? . Should we stop the turbine to drain out or increase speed to 1,500 rpm and continue warming up ?. Are there need longer warm up than normally start up ?. During the washing, the machine drains shall be kept open (consequent loss of vacuum is not an issue). Once the washing is finished, slightly close the BFW valve and wait for the superheated temperature stabilization. Keep the temperature stable for 5 minutes and then close the drains.. From this point, increase the speed from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. Warm up for 10 minutes @ 1500 rpm and then follow the normal start-up ramps.. 11 Check the schedule of GE supervisor to supervise washing procedure as soon as possible. Joe to provide answer. 12 When washing turbine with 500 rpm, if there are BFW in liquid state go through the turbine. What're the effect for turbine ? . Being the BFW valve Â½\" size, no major water slugs are expected. Moreover, making the washing at 500 rpm limits the risk of damages.. 13 From guide line item 1, Turbine shall cool down to 100 C. Kindly advise where is the position on the casing to measure temperature. Is it TI-530 or use infrared temp to check at casing surface ? OK. 14 Due to our time constrain, Are there any method to cool down the turbine faster than natural cool down ?Can we remove the insulation out to faster cool down ? Absolutely NOT . From your experience, can you advise estimate time for cool down the turbine ? 6-8 hours. 15 Kindly advise essentially concern and caution for startup after turbine washing finish. See point 10.

Sub-sync with broadband appeared in the radial bearing (DE,NDE) vibration spectrum indicating process instability. ASV 1 hunting as we tried to increase load. Suction piping between scrubber and compressor experienced high vibration. Upon further investigation, we found flow transmitter FT2411 faulty and giving flow reading even during unit not running. This evening, we managed to replace the transmitter and verified its functionality. As we proceed with start-up, we manage to reach minimum load with low vibration readings and the sub sync signal had disappeared. However, out of sudden CCC triggered Shut Down on Multiple Surges. I believe it is not genuine since thrust bearing temperature very low, radial vibration low, and axial position maintain. Safety On appeared in the alarm list but there was no Surge Count. Simultaneously after GCM1 tripped, all parameter readings at GCM3 HMI turned to zero. This situation happened twice tonight. It seems like there was an interruption in network communication between TCP, CCC, and HMI.. Please see the attached OSM alarm list and trends from the events.. As reported in the SR, customer has solved the issue at site. Basically the CCC calculated the wrong operating point during operation due to the Compressor Instrumentation failure. (Temperature/Pressure/Flow â Compressor Parameters). Due to this reason CCC always initiate \"CCC Multiple Surge\" when it thinks that the compressor work not at the right operating point.

The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) .

This is also in reference to the Maximo SR 90119212 and 90118404. Engineering team is requested to support on this. . QUOTE. I would like to ask your support on the HP BFW pumps (0P-6202A-H). We have recently removed the end cover of the B pump, due to seal failure, and found that the end cover had again eroded under the gasket surface. For this pump the gasket thickness was reduced in October last year, then also the end cover had extensive repair due to erosion. Now it is clear that the reduction of the gasket thickness is not the (complete) solution. . Changing the material of the end cover has been discussed, as I read in attached email. But I believe that there should not be any flow under the gasket area, and hence changing the material of the end cover is just a (very expensive) Band-Aid for an underlying problem. Could you please ask your engineering team to have a look at this, and support us in finding an explanation of the damage? Perhaps it is good to have a telephone call to discuss way forward on this topic?. UNQUOTE. When customer have opened a Boiler Feed Water (BFW) pump due to seal failure, the end cover of the pump is found to be eroded under the gasket surface. The customer suggests that changing the end cover material is just a Band-Aid for an underlying problem and that there should not be any flow under the gasket.

      "Gorgon CO2 project. Seal gas system. According to SOS9973868 functional description: Very low pressure in the primary vent lines, meaning the secondary gas seal has failed, is detected by transmitters PZ-8035A/B/C (PZLL-8035, 2oo3 voting) and PZ-8041A/B/C (PZLL-8041, 2oo3 voting) and if the relative very low threshold (PZLL-8035 or PZLL8041, 10kPa) are exceeded for more than 10 seconds (continuative), this will result in a compressor trip without vent and related alarm indication.. Can we please ask BHGE Engineering if it is normal to see quite a low pressure in the primary vent of the HP compressors (as read on PZ-8035 and PZ-8041) during pressurized stand-still? . For example, when 3K-1901B tripped this week, with primary vent open to atmosphere and there was 190 kpag in the casing, PZI8541 read 17 kpag and PZI8535 read 13 kpag. This is quite normal values for us to see in the pressurized stand-still case and has the potential to cause us issues on re-starts as the trip setpoint is 10kpag. For the case of 2K-1901B, 319PZI8541 reads 10-11kpag and we have been required to force this when it dipped below 10 kpag for the nitrogen runs. It seems like a very tight margin from the pressures we are seeing in the primary vent to the trip set point. . On the base of provided data, it can be seen that valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 are completely open during pressurized stand-still condition and this fact explain the low pressure (close to trip threshold 10 Kpa) measured on primary vent by PT8034 and PT8038 during pressurized stand-still.. The condition to be forced 100% open for primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 during pressurized stand-still phase is not required (as confirmed by Control System Functional Description SOS9973868 sheet 10/23), so we suggest to remove the above said condition so that primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 will work as per design (regulating their opening in order to keep 1bar upstream themselves) during pressurized stand-still condition..

Based on the latest results received from Site, we observed that the unit is having troubles in reaching the crank speed. The desired purge speed was barely reached but having always the swash plate at 100%. Several pressure measurements were taken on the circuit to locate the possible source of the issue, after the latest adjustment on the Max Flow the unit was able to reach the crank speed.

Apparenly there is now issue since on PPRA pack are condigured and wired only speed pick-up probes.. In the past this issue came up , the only way to reset it was to switch off the entire G controller and power on again.. Swithing off the individual pack will not solve the issue.. The speed signal seems like working fine , even the PreVote signal are ok.. Unit is running now. Faults is related to PR2 and PR5 as shown an screen-shot attached,. The diagnostics are showing that all three I/O packs are reading a mismatch for 77LC speed pick-ups. It means that between 77LC1 (PR2) and 77LC2 (PR5) there is a difference of 25rpm, even if prevote data are almost aligned. First of all verify if \"dual_difflimit\" is set to 25 by checking in \"PulseRate2\" configuration parameters. After this, my suggestion is to check the wiring correct as per UCP wiring SOM6753639 sh.106 with 77LC1 connected to TREA 45-46 and 77LC2 to 27-28. In the end, I suggest to perform a test by simulating the speed directly on TREA (with frequency generator) and with jumper between PR2 and PR5. If the diagnostic cannot be resetted, the problem probably is on card itself, otherwise there is field issue.. As confirmed by requestor, the case will be closed.

      "On the 5th of June 2019 post the L1 service startup, the Train2 PR2 High Speed Power Turbine (HSPT) vibration readings on the casing accelerometer started trending up close to the trip limit of 25mm/s. The increase in the casing vibration is confirmed to be only on Tr2PR2 and not on other units. Multiple hypotheses exists ranging from residual varnish deposition on HSPT journal bearing 1, restriction in thermal growth, rotor unbalance, rotor-dynamics changes, and bearing 1 damage. The root cause of the casing vibration has not yet been determined. The most likely hypotheses are: 1. Actual mechanical damage on the HSPT bearings.. 2. The effects of MLO DTE-932 and residual varnish on this HSPT bearing 1. . From the current RM&D trend we could see that the vibration on the sesmic probe and the proximeter probes have reduced and the behaviour is consistent with the vibration levels observed prior to oil replacement activity during L1. Oil varnish is considered to be a contributing factor for the vibration spike. . With the above finding there is no requirement to increase the sesmic vibration limit from 25 mm/sec to 35 mm/sec, further after discussion with level 3 the sesmic vibration setpoint increase from 25mm/sec to 35mm/sec cannot be approved as this affects the HSPT integrity.

      "Customer BP Alaska is ordering liners 224B9793G026/27/28/29/30 for the CAP & LINER Assembly for their FR5/1 engines.. The customer claims that during the time they started to receive different type of Cap assemblies. As you can see from the attachment, they claim that originally they were receiving liners with Cap P/N 164B1793G006, but the cowl for this Cap is actually made with Louvers and not Holes.. The cap with the cowl with holes having the patttern of the picture should be the 164B1793G001. Cowl P/N is 164B1801P001. The Cap that they are receiving now have the Cap 164B1793G013 with Cowl 164B4415P001.. The customer has questions about this difference: . 1) What are the performance implications with the revised cap and cowl design? Will the emissions change and if so by how much?. 2) Can the two types of liners be mixed within sets?. 3) Can you or confirm whether the G006 cap is still available. As stated below, we have an incomplete set of liners with the G006 cap.. Thank you,. Alfredo. As per problem description. (score is 1.0000)\n",

      "We have inspected the suction strainers on our J24 K101A/102A recip recycle compressors (see P and ID in attached email showing OEM commissioning strainers) and the screen image is attached. I cannot understand why we have such a fine mesh on the outside of the perforated plate as I thought this would have been the commissioning filter only and once fully commissioned the fine mesh would be removed leaving the perforated plate only. Currently the manual says we should have an suction filter DP alarm at 0.3bar which is 4.3 psi however we do not have DP transmitter but gauges which are 0 to 800 psi so 4 psi is not discernable on the gauge.. Can you make a recommendation for the OEM strainer size and also state the disadvantages of such a fine mesh on the compressor reliability if any. Can the fine suction mesh be causing damage to the cylinder valves etc. Please be noted that provided conical strainers in each compressor suction piping are temporary strainers, tailored for use in the initial period of operation (commissioning) of the compressor to avoid any solid particles that may be present in the piping due to construction completion could arrive to the compressor internals. . These temporary strainers are composed by a conical supporting plate with holes, on which it is assembled the first wire net having a 22 mesh opening size. Above this 22 mesh net it is provided a finer wire net, having 220 mesh opening size. With this arrangement, the filter is suitable for withstand 3 bar maximum differential pressure (as mechanical design). . Please refer to process gas P&I Diagram doc.

Also, there was no differential pressure transmitter except provision for differential pressure gauge. . With the above information, We could confirm the provided temporary strainers are not suitable for the continuous service instead only for Initial commissioning purposes. Usually after commissioning by ensuring no more dirt in the piping, strainers will be removed from the service leaving the units without any strainers. However, in between If any construction work in the piping has been carried out upstream the compressor we recommend to install again the temporary strainers during initial operation period. . In case of leaving these temporary strainers in service for a longer period may expose a risk of failure of the strainers (as they are not designed for continuous service) and subsequent damage to the compressor internals..

      "----------------------------------------------------. The fault is detailed below from one of our Ex GE Field Service Engineers (Darren Sheard) who now works on Buzzard. Screenshots of the events have been attached.. GTB tripped last night at full load on VSV position error and then the unit did not load reject well and the GG shaft went into over speed conditions during the shutdown.. See attached Trend of the event. • Highlighted sections in red show the VSVSEL and VSVDMD (VSV demand and feedback) tracking together and running ok at approx. 12%. Then drifting to 32.5% and 5% respectively they should be tracking equally. An error between the two of greater than 10% is a step to idle then trip. • Highlighted green sections show the GG shaft (NGGSEL) going into over speed conditions (greater than 10300 rpm) after the initial event.. The over speed trip was secondary to the VSV position error (see attached alarm screen and first out data) . However the governor should still control the turbine in a full load rejection condition without going into over speed. Although I suspect if the VSV did not move on schedule this would not have helped the issue.. From the trend you can see the VSV demand and feedback error. In my opinion this is what we should be concentrating on. I have attached the trouble shooting guides from the manual (TS18) (WP41100). . We plan to go in and have a look at the VSV system to see if there is anything obvious (ie loose cannon plugs or obvious signs of damage) After this is completed and if nothing obvious has been found we would like to know if further troubleshooting measure should be taken or what the next step would be to ensure safe return to operation.. .

      "On PAB platform is operating a unit not covered by our CSA contract: however the client is asking help on following issue, please refer below description. Attached you can find formal request came by client with m6b attached. Quote. we are having some issues with our Booster Compressor K0401-01. The recycle valve is opening to values of 80-90% and it is apparently due to the detection of surge, therefore the surge control logic increases the setpoint of the controller forcing it to open faster. We havent been able to find process reasons for such a sudden change, but when looking at it closer our Rotating Equipment engineer has determined that the compressor is operating at incipient surge region, meaning that the Surge Control Line (SCL) is actually at the incipient surge region.. Unquote. . See attached mail customer agree to close the SR because they are going to shutdown the unit for UCP upgrade. But I still suggest to record the issue, keep the following information to the control requisition engineer in this upgrade in order to anticipate issue in future.. ----------------------------------. According to Walter's statement, if it is a sudden open instead of steady open, most likely the 'transient absorption' is ON. This is a designed regulation/protection, as a feature of anti-surge controller. Usually it be activated when process condition change ratio exceed a certain threshold. For example, fluctuation on flow measurement. If it is a steady open, it means operation point is approaching to SCL.. However, in order to help customer evaluate this 'transient absorption' activation event, we still need to start with data analysis. Please get the required data.. The possibilities will include but not limited to: . - A real process fluctuation. - A slight process fluctuation with a too sensitive detection parameter tuned. - A instrumentation / cabling issue which introduce noise in loop. - A steady operation with insufficient suction flow. About raised questions by customer: . Q1.Can we operate the KT-0401 in the long term with 40% (once in a while -95%) open recycle valves?. A: as for equipment itself, there is no issue. However, it is of energy waste. If ASV staying stable at 40%, that usually means there is not enough suction flow to feed compressor at that speed (if suction and discharge pressure ratio is to be maintained). Customer may consider lower compressor speed manually or regulated by process controller. After we receive the data, we can have more precise evaluation. . Q2.We may have to adjust the SCL even more to the right? Or have a study carried out how to modify the unit?. A: If the suction condition ( including suction temperature, pressure, gas molecular weight is not far away from designed condition, there is no need to shift SCL in general, unless the set SCL has issue which may be seen from data analysis and other check on e.g flow element sheet.

      "As per attached mail Customer is suffering overheating at partial load and detouch of liners coating. please address the SR to Leonardo Raugei who is working already on this. Daniele and Antonio, good morning,. As per experience overheating we don't see direct reading of the measured discharge temperature of the cylinder, to better understand the phenomena we need to have these values. Usually rather than the liner condition, if the overheating is seen only with crank end loaded, the condition of the suction and discharge valves shall be verified. In general in any case when only one of the two cylinder ends is loaded the discharge temperature tends to increase but again we need measured values to estimated this. Valve cover skin temperature, measured with infrared probe, may also give an idea about thermodynamic behavior.. The liner condition in any case, will affect the wear of the rider bands and, considering also that is in operation since several years, a replacement is suggested. For the mate unit, our job 1001801 serial n°A07967 we already faced that in case of material replacement the preferred one is cast iron, considering that tungsten carbide coating was not performing well on this application. A part n° for an oversized liners and relevant spacer, with allowance to be machined and adapted depending on the actual measurement of the cylinder liner housing bore, was already made and shared in 2018..

The card has had error issues which we attributed to shielding issues. We fixed the shielding and the problem appeared to have gone away. Also had issues with LED status which we fixed by just rebooting(after we inspected the card for overheating, dust build-up, and bent back-plane pins.. Yesterday afternoon the card finally stopped working. It is not even recognized as being in the rack (error 8325.). We tried cleaning the card, and also swapping the card with one from the PLC in GT1.. see first reply. Assisted FSE in problem resolution (score is 0.4292)\n",

The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. . In first analysis I suppose that this TRIP was cause from an issue on PESS (PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC SAFETY SYSTEM) from customer side..

Sub-sync with broadband appeared in the radial bearing (DE,NDE) vibration spectrum indicating process instability. ASV 1 hunting as we tried to increase load. Suction piping between scrubber and compressor experienced high vibration. Upon further investigation, we found flow transmitter FT2411 faulty and giving flow reading even during unit not running. This evening, we managed to replace the transmitter and verified its functionality. As we proceed with start-up, we manage to reach minimum load with low vibration readings and the sub sync signal had disappeared. However, out of sudden CCC triggered Shut Down on Multiple Surges. I believe it is not genuine since thrust bearing temperature very low, radial vibration low, and axial position maintain. Safety On appeared in the alarm list but there was no Surge Count. Simultaneously after GCM1 tripped, all parameter readings at GCM3 HMI turned to zero. This situation happened twice tonight. It seems like there was an interruption in network communication between TCP, CCC, and HMI.. Please see the attached OSM alarm list and trends from the events.. As reported in the SR, customer has solved the issue at site. Basically the CCC calculated the wrong operating point during operation due to the Compressor Instrumentation failure. (Temperature/Pressure/Flow â Compressor Parameters). Due to this reason CCC always initiate \"CCC Multiple Surge\" when it thinks that the compressor work not at the right operating point.

      "After a pressurized shutdown is not possible to restart the unit due to missing permissive from antisurge controller (AS1_L3AS_RTS) because during SOP state (around 11-12 BarG) the compressors stages inlet pressure transmitters are out of scale giving a fault to antisurge controller.. Based on IL, SOL47654, the instruments at site should be Honeywell STG840 with a calibration range available of -1Ã·35barg.. We calculated the reference and the expected accuracy in case of calibration span increase to -1Ã·15barg: the reference accuracy would be 9mbar (about 1% of reading in normal operating condition).. On the 8th of August, we recommended to increase the calibration span of the instruments as follow for next start up (both instrument and controller): - PIT5643 from -1 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2640 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2644 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2639from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2641 from 0 min. to +15 barg,. - PIT2642 from 0 min. to +15 barg.. Site team has already implemented the above mentioned calibration range and tested the AntiSurge controller operation to be smooth at the following startup.. On the 26th of August Site team has communicated \"we tested the modification and it is working fine. we can go ahead for as-built and case closure\".

In case the cause and effect diagram is no alligned to the actual software I suggest you to make up and to add it on this case to proceed with the as built.. Due to the fact that this SR is relate to the safety PLC I move the case to LEV 3 for final approval..

      "At first exposure to site, 56\" Flange on PR Train 2 3MCL1404 compressor has been found with pitting on surface of raised face.. Customer has requested clarification for acceptable limits for pitting to determine whether the flange requires machining.. Depth of pitting cannot be measured due to unavailability of required tooling, but appears to be deeper than bottom of serration.. Previously for Train 1 PR 3MCL, 56\" flange was also discovered with pitting across more than 30% of the sealing surface. QA/QC of customer rejected the flange condition and the flange was machined on site (SR 90084714). . According to information shared we noted: - Flange conformity according to ASME is not guaranteed as stated in the attached documents. - We do not have a direct experience of how the flange could operate with such defects. - On train 1 a similar defect was re-machined at site.. In addition we cannot guarantee correct sealing of the flange and the risk of gas leakage during first pressurization could lead to perform re-machining after installation of customer piping with shorter time to operate and under customer pressure. For above reason we cannot consider to take the risk of leaving the flange as is and re-machining is required. .
