This is also in reference to the Maximo SR 90119212 and 90118404. Engineering team is requested to support on this. . QUOTE. I would like to ask your support on the HP BFW pumps (0P-6202A-H). We have recently removed the end cover of the B pump, due to seal failure, and found that the end cover had again eroded under the gasket surface. For this pump the gasket thickness was reduced in October last year, then also the end cover had extensive repair due to erosion. Now it is clear that the reduction of the gasket thickness is not the (complete) solution. . Changing the material of the end cover has been discussed, as I read in attached email. But I believe that there should not be any flow under the gasket area, and hence changing the material of the end cover is just a (very expensive) Band-Aid for an underlying problem. Could you please ask your engineering team to have a look at this, and support us in finding an explanation of the damage? Perhaps it is good to have a telephone call to discuss way forward on this topic?. UNQUOTE.

       " 3: ['On the 5th of June 2019 post the L1 service startup, the Train2 PR2 High Speed Power Turbine (HSPT) vibration readings on the casing accelerometer started trending up close to the trip limit of 25mm/s. The increase in the casing vibration is confirmed to be only on Tr2PR2 and not on other units. Multiple hypotheses exists ranging from residual varnish deposition on HSPT journal bearing 1, restriction in thermal growth, rotor unbalance, rotor-dynamics changes, and bearing 1 damage. The root cause of the casing vibration has not yet been determined. The most likely hypotheses are: 1. Actual mechanical damage on the HSPT bearings.. 2. The effects of MLO DTE-932 and residual varnish on this HSPT bearing 1. . From the current RM&D trend we could see that the vibration on the sesmic probe and the proximeter probes have reduced and the behaviour is consistent with the vibration levels observed prior to oil replacement activity during L1. Oil varnish is considered to be a contributing factor for the vibration spike. . With the above finding there is no requirement to increase the sesmic vibration limit from 25 mm/sec to 35 mm/sec, further after discussion with level 3 the sesmic vibration setpoint increase from 25mm/sec to 35mm/sec cannot be approved as this affects the HSPT integrity.',\n",
       "  'Seeking advise on ST problem. Good after noon, I am Kraisorn who response in rotating machine maintenance in Bangchak refinery.. We have problem about the steam turbine 4KT-4001.. Now, Governor open about 90% at speed 7,900 rpm. Normally we operate at 8,300 rpm but now can\\'t increase speed to that point.. We check the 1st stage pressure, It has trend to increase since mid of October until now this value is 38 bar (Inlet pressure 40 bar). The turbine NDE axial vibration change from -0.20 mm to -0.02 mm but other vibration are normal.. Could you please advise about this problem and how to check and method to solve this problem . Thank you for your support.. Here below the questions/answers exchanged during the call.. 1 While turbine run at speed around 7,500 rpm, can we introduce the superheat steam (Dry steam) but have margin temp. higher than saturated steam a little bit to washing the turbine ? In order to try washing the turbine the steam has to be saturated. Keeping a temperature in between the operating superheated and the saturated one would be not effective. Moreover, it\\'s strongly not advisable to play with the temperature while the turbine run at high speed, in fact possible water slugs could compromise the machine integrity. The steam may be condensed to wet steam after pass first or second stage and then washing the deposit on the stage after. Can we use this method to washing the turbine ? see above. How much the pressure and temperature that recommend ? see above. What are the concern for this method ? see above. 2 While washing turbine at 500 rpm, steam should be wetted before entrance the turbine that mean wet steam may be condensed before last stage. The washing may not efficient it can cause unbalance or vibration problem after washing or not. As already explained in the very first replies, vibration issues could happen after washing, but they would be not due to washing efficiency. Depending on the thickness and \\'hardness\\' of the deposits, they could be removed not evenly and therefore provoke unbalance. 3 From guide line no. 1-2, Why need to shut down the turbine and cool down casing to 100 C after that start up again to 1,500 rpm. The aim is to induce some thermal transients that should facilitate the deposits detaching (due to the different thermal expansion between steel and deposits). 4 When run turbine at 500 rpm, how to keep compressor run ? Because there are not enough pressure for sealing DGS. If you have not clean external buffer gas, this could be a problem.. 5 Can we remove coupling spacer then washing the turbine during solo run ? Governor valve can control turbine speed at 500 rpm when solo run or not. Usually Yes. 6 If governor valve cannot control speed at 500 rpm. Are there speed allowance for this procedure ? Less than 700 rpm. 7 Are there any detail procedure for wet steam washing ? Please submit to us. How much steam temperature decreasing rate when open BFW valve ? Depends on the plant arrangement. Best practice is always to look for temperature stabilization (about 5 minutes) before to increase the BFW opening.. 8 Please submit the control limit of conductivity (<0.1 mS/cm), SiO2 (< 5 ppm) or etc for BFW. BFW (Boiler Feed Water) properties provided are the ones we specify for a good operation of our steam turbines. What we can say is that the washing will be as much effective as the BFW properties will be closed to the specified. 9 Are there any procedure to clean turbine when turbine stop ? . For example, turbine stop we fill up water inside the turbine and then rotate shaft by turning device to rinse the contaminate and drain out.. Please advise. No. 10 Could you please advise start up step after washing finish ? . Should we stop the turbine to drain out or increase speed to 1,500 rpm and continue warming up ?. Are there need longer warm up than normally start up ?. During the washing, the machine drains shall be kept open (consequent loss of vacuum is not an issue). Once the washing is finished, slightly close the BFW valve and wait for the superheated temperature stabilization. Keep the temperature stable for 5 minutes and then close the drains.. From this point, increase the speed from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. Warm up for 10 minutes @ 1500 rpm and then follow the normal start-up ramps.. 11 Check the schedule of GE supervisor to supervise washing procedure as soon as possible. Joe to provide answer. 12 When washing turbine with 500 rpm, if there are BFW in liquid state go through the turbine. What\\'re the effect for turbine ? . Being the BFW valve Â½\" size, no major water slugs are expected. Moreover, making the washing at 500 rpm limits the risk of damages.. 13 From guide line item 1, Turbine shall cool down to 100 C. Kindly advise where is the position on the casing to measure temperature. Is it TI-530 or use infrared temp to check at casing surface ? OK. 14 Due to our time constrain, Are there any method to cool down the turbine faster than natural cool down ?Can we remove the insulation out to faster cool down ? Absolutely NOT . From your experience, can you advise estimate time for cool down the turbine ? 6-8 hours. 15 Kindly advise essentially concern and caution for startup after turbine washing finish. See point 10.

Ci-dessous ce que j'ai prÃ©parÃ©.. Merci d'apporter vos commentaires avant diffusion si besoin avant jeudi 09/05/2019. C2701 BP Rotterdam. Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â\\x80¢ gas composition. â\\x80¢ suction temperature. â\\x80¢ suction pressure. â\\x80¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â\\x80¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â\\x80¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï\\x83\\x98 Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â\\x80¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â\\x80¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â\\x80¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â\\x80¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï\\x83\\x98 As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. .\",\n",

Here we have couple of questions for Nuovo Pignone as the OEM of this machine.. - What is the slow roll speed for this machine? . - Is there a minimum RPM limitation for slow rolling due to lubrication properties? . - Is there an OEM procedure for rotor stretching? .

       "  'RMD received the following email today from the customer following a high vibration trip notification issued to them-. GCM1 experienced radial high vibration trip when we tried to increase load after it reaches the minimum load with compressor speed 70%. Upon further investigation, findings are summarized as follow.. Sub-sync with broadband appeared in the radial bearing (DE,NDE) vibration spectrum indicating process instability. ASV 1 hunting as we tried to increase load. Suction piping between scrubber and compressor experienced high vibration. Upon further investigation, we found flow transmitter FT2411 faulty and giving flow reading even during unit not running. This evening, we managed to replace the transmitter and verified its functionality. As we proceed with start-up, we manage to reach minimum load with low vibration readings and the sub sync signal had disappeared. However, out of sudden CCC triggered Shut Down on Multiple Surges. I believe it is not genuine since thrust bearing temperature very low, radial vibration low, and axial position maintain. Safety On appeared in the alarm list but there was no Surge Count. Simultaneously after GCM1 tripped, all parameter readings at GCM3 HMI turned to zero. This situation happened twice tonight. It seems like there was an interruption in network communication between TCP, CCC, and HMI.. Please see the attached OSM alarm list and trends from the events.. As reported in the SR, customer has solved the issue at site. Basically the CCC calculated the wrong operating point during operation due to the Compressor Instrumentation failure. (Temperature/Pressure/Flow â\\x80\\x93 Compressor Parameters). Due to this reason CCC always initiate \"CCC Multiple Surge\" when it thinks that the compressor work not at the right operating point.

The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. .

The customer could verify the wiring connection and screw tightening..

Upon checking the transformer inside MCC the input voltage from the customer is correct 415 V single phase but the output is around 249 V. The rated of transformer is 415 V to 240 V.. 3. The bulb is only 230 V rated.. 4. Meanwhile testing of enclosure lighting is temporary stop due to this issues.. At site it is found that bulbs are blown up due to incorrect supply voltage.. After investigation it is found that bulbs are blown up due supply voltage is 250VAC and this is correct because the transformer has an rate voltage of 240VAC but +-5% tolerance.. As attached proposal, the only possible solution, considering that we can't find in the market bulb with rating voltage of 240 or 250VAC, is to add a dedicated transformer 240VAC/220VAC for only enclosure lighting.. For this reason we need to purchase (refer to attached email with quotation received by ABB) for each unit. - n.1 transformer 240/220VAC 1500VA price 219,00â\\x82¬. - n 1 breaker MT 2P 16A curva D codice 566814 price 53,89â\\x82¬ .

Sometimes this is because of the sudden loss of diferential pressure of the Seal Oil System.. 2. Poor hermeticity of the mechanical seals in the housing because of posible wrong selection of o\\'rings.. 3. A lot of oil flowing out the mechanical seals. The amount of oil we see in the flow oil glasses located in the drain lines is too much and apparently abnormal. We\\'ve checked the mechanical seals faces for excesive wear, craks, etc. and they\\'re most of the times \"OK\". No signs of separation of the faces that could get the oil flowing out them increased.. 4. Sudden lose of Reference and Equalization Gas, then the situation gets into control but sometimes it doesn\\'t and it makes dificult to maintain the system in control.. 5.

When we try to get out of service one pump we get the diferential pressure decreased and it can shut down the compressor.. 6. Oil Accumulator Tank doesn\\'t respond as it should.. 7.

       "  'Gorgon CO2 project. Seal gas system. According to SOS9973868 functional description: Very low pressure in the primary vent lines, meaning the secondary gas seal has failed, is detected by transmitters PZ-8035A/B/C (PZLL-8035, 2oo3 voting) and PZ-8041A/B/C (PZLL-8041, 2oo3 voting) and if the relative very low threshold (PZLL-8035 or PZLL8041, 10kPa) are exceeded for more than 10 seconds (continuative), this will result in a compressor trip without vent and related alarm indication.. Can we please ask BHGE Engineering if it is normal to see quite a low pressure in the primary vent of the HP compressors (as read on PZ-8035 and PZ-8041) during pressurized stand-still? . For example, when 3K-1901B tripped this week, with primary vent open to atmosphere and there was 190 kpag in the casing, PZI8541 read 17 kpag and PZI8535 read 13 kpag. This is quite normal values for us to see in the pressurized stand-still case and has the potential to cause us issues on re-starts as the trip setpoint is 10kpag. For the case of 2K-1901B, 319PZI8541 reads 10-11kpag and we have been required to force this when it dipped below 10 kpag for the nitrogen runs. It seems like a very tight margin from the pressures we are seeing in the primary vent to the trip set point. . On the base of provided data, it can be seen that valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 are completely open during pressurized stand-still condition and this fact explain the low pressure (close to trip threshold 10 Kpa) measured on primary vent by PT8034 and PT8038 during pressurized stand-still.. The condition to be forced 100% open for primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 during pressurized stand-still phase is not required (as confirmed by Control System Functional Description SOS9973868 sheet 10/23), so we suggest to remove the above said condition so that primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 will work as per design (regulating their opening in order to keep 1bar upstream themselves) during pressurized stand-still condition..

Currently the manual says we should have an suction filter DP alarm at 0.3bar which is 4.3 psi however we do not have DP transmitter but gauges which are 0 to 800 psi so 4 psi is not discernable on the gauge.. Can you make a recommendation for the OEM strainer size and also state the disadvantages of such a fine mesh on the compressor reliability if any. Can the fine suction mesh be causing damage to the cylinder valves etc. Please be noted that provided conical strainers in each compressor suction piping are temporary strainers, tailored for use in the initial period of operation (commissioning) of the compressor to avoid any solid particles that may be present in the piping due to construction completion could arrive to the compressor internals. .

Screenshots of the events have been attached.. GTB tripped last night at full load on VSV position error and then the unit did not load reject well and the GG shaft went into over speed conditions during the shutdown.. See attached Trend of the event. • Highlighted sections in red show the VSVSEL and VSVDMD (VSV demand and feedback) tracking together and running ok at approx. 12%. Then drifting to 32.5% and 5% respectively they should be tracking equally. An error between the two of greater than 10% is a step to idle then trip. • Highlighted green sections show the GG shaft (NGGSEL) going into over speed conditions (greater than 10300 rpm) after the initial event.. The over speed trip was secondary to the VSV position error (see attached alarm screen and first out data) . However the governor should still control the turbine in a full load rejection condition without going into over speed. Although I suspect if the VSV did not move on schedule this would not have helped the issue.. From the trend you can see the VSV demand and feedback error. In my opinion this is what we should be concentrating on. I have attached the trouble shooting guides from the manual (TS18) (WP41100). . We plan to go in and have a look at the VSV system to see if there is anything obvious (ie loose cannon plugs or obvious signs of damage) After this is completed and if nothing obvious has been found we would like to know if further troubleshooting measure should be taken or what the next step would be to ensure safe return to operation.. .

       " 14: ['Manitowoc Public Utilities Frame 5 CT Issues. Background: The unit was last successfully started and run on 1/10 for a short run to test a new auto synchronizing relay. Temperatures were typical for Wisconsin at the time (25-30 degrees). Yesterday (1/30), we were requested to start our CT and be online at around 0500. Temperatures were about minus 20 degrees with blowing snow. We also had a significant snow fall on Monday (12+ inches) with major blowing and drifting. So that is the background for our start.. We started the unit on NG around 0500 in the morning and synched onto the grid. After our normal 10 minute warm up period at 2 MW load was increased to ~11.5 MW. The unit appeared to be stable and running at ~11.5 MW for just over 1/2 hour when it tripped. Unfortunately the exact cause is now a bit hard to determine as our control PLC is not logging alarm history (a separate issue we are looking into). While it was all happening, I ended up hitting a reset, thinking I could go back to the alarm history, but the history is not there. There were a number of alarms and I know at least one Shutdown alarm was OVERSPEED TRIP. However, we did not see indication that speed got that high (108%). If it did it was very short.. After the unit rolled down and became ready for a restart, we attempted a 2nd start. At about 60% speed the unit tripped on High Vibration of the #2 Turbine Bearing (Trips at 1 in/sec. velocity). The vibrations are definitely real, as we could feel it on the startup. We suspected the trip from load with the extreme cold temperatures could have caused a bow in the shaft. We left the unit on the jack for about 7 hours. We were again asked to run and attempted another start around 1400. This time the unit tripped on High Exhaust Gas Temp and High Vibration at the same time. Vibration has typically not been an issue with this unit, and we are at a loss as to the cause of the High EGT.. Finally, for some additional information, we looked at the trends from the initial run and trip and can see there were 4 or 5 instances of significant MW load spikes (2+ MW swings in very short time frame). These swings corresponds with spikes in the Inter-Stage Gas Pressure. I believe that the NG header pressure regulator was sticking, causing spikes in the supply header pressure as the unit was running. These spikes resulted in sudden power surges in the turbine, which ultimately lead to the trip.

No changes on control system is recommended at this time as this is not a GE supplied control system.. . Potential turbine parts failure.

Attached you can find formal request came by client with m6b attached. Quote. we are having some issues with our Booster Compressor K0401-01. The recycle valve is opening to values of 80-90% and it is apparently due to the detection of surge, therefore the surge control logic increases the setpoint of the controller forcing it to open faster. We havent been able to find process reasons for such a sudden change, but when looking at it closer our Rotating Equipment engineer has determined that the compressor is operating at incipient surge region, meaning that the Surge Control Line (SCL) is actually at the incipient surge region.. Unquote. . See attached mail customer agree to close the SR because they are going to shutdown the unit for UCP upgrade. But I still suggest to record the issue, keep the following information to the control requisition engineer in this upgrade in order to anticipate issue in future.. ----------------------------------. According to Walter's statement, if it is a sudden open instead of steady open, most likely the 'transient absorption' is ON. This is a designed regulation/protection, as a feature of anti-surge controller. Usually it be activated when process condition change ratio exceed a certain threshold. For example, fluctuation on flow measurement. If it is a steady open, it means operation point is approaching to SCL.. However, in order to help customer evaluate this 'transient absorption' activation event, we still need to start with data analysis. Please get the required data.. The possibilities will include but not limited to: . - A real process fluctuation. - A slight process fluctuation with a too sensitive detection parameter tuned. - A instrumentation / cabling issue which introduce noise in loop. - A steady operation with insufficient suction flow. About raised questions by customer: . Q1.Can we operate the KT-0401 in the long term with 40% (once in a while -95%) open recycle valves?. A: as for equipment itself, there is no issue. However, it is of energy waste. If ASV staying stable at 40%, that usually means there is not enough suction flow to feed compressor at that speed (if suction and discharge pressure ratio is to be maintained). Customer may consider lower compressor speed manually or regulated by process controller. After we receive the data, we can have more precise evaluation. . Q2.We may have to adjust the SCL even more to the right? Or have a study carried out how to modify the unit?. A: If the suction condition ( including suction temperature, pressure, gas molecular weight is not far away from designed condition, there is no need to shift SCL in general, unless the set SCL has issue which may be seen from data analysis and other check on e.g flow element sheet. This can be discuss later.. customer request for technical support.\"],\n",

We do not have past experiences on the LM6000.. Similar case happened on LM2500 was due to not enough seal air on the sump during the crank..

In fact, the steam flowing throw the PV-123 is about 230 kg/h (against about 190 kg/h in the previous run at a PIC-123 pressure set equal to 0,3 barg;. • 2.

Looking forward your urgent reply I ask you to dedicate to Sper the due attention as per the Contract in place and the Client history. 1- excessive steam leakage: according to client answers (attached), the flow is measured (and increase of temperature in the flash tank), so there are no doubt about increase in flow. The operating conditions are also same as before. we reviewed the clearance record from site and we had comments and found 2 factors that may explain the excessive leaks compared to design (attached powerpoint presentation). After discussion with the FSE, the measurement were the same at dissassembly and reassembly. There did not replace the seals as they were in good condition. Due to short outage timing, discrepencies observed were noted in the report and shall be taken into account for preparation of next major overhaul (fixed seals damaged (radial - axial), removed, diaphrams damaged).. The difference of leak before and after outage of 40 kg/h described by client could therefore be explained : . -potential abnormal working condition of the steam gland condenser. -cleaning of the rotor that may have generate small additional clearance at some locations.. 2- client accept the plan described in first reply above about loss of ZT.. ras',\n",

Based on the latest results received from Site, we observed that the unit is having troubles in reaching the crank speed. The desired purge speed was barely reached but having always the swash plate at 100%. Several pressure measurements were taken on the circuit to locate the possible source of the issue, after the latest adjustment on the Max Flow the unit was able to reach the crank speed. This seems to indicate there is a lack of flow on the oil circuit that was somehow compensated by the Max Flow adjustment. Investigation shown a fair response of 90HS valve, while there is seems to be a possible leakage from the solenoid 20HS. This point will be checked further using a thermo camera that will be provided from customer. Most likely the issue is on 20HS which we recommend to be replaced as next step.

This findings, depending on HPTs speed lack still there or that, will reveal if the problem was addressable to something outside module ( Anti Surge Valve, VSV schedule by UCP) or to the module itself.. 3 - If the problem wont be resolved by module swap, it will be sufficient the new SR above, as we will have to focus on something still at site and not related to engine. On the opposite, if the problem will be fixed, it will be necessary a second new SR, to define a dedicated checklist to inspect the modules ( HPT and LPT) at the workshop to try to detect what causes the poor HPT speed..

After involving the process operability team, we confirm that the valve in subject must be operated always in manual. The purpose is to heat up the suction to avoid hydrates formation.

This is also in reference to the Maximo SR 90119212 and 90118404. Engineering team is requested to support on this. . QUOTE. I would like to ask your support on the HP BFW pumps (0P-6202A-H). We have recently removed the end cover of the B pump, due to seal failure, and found that the end cover had again eroded under the gasket surface. For this pump the gasket thickness was reduced in October last year, then also the end cover had extensive repair due to erosion. Now it is clear that the reduction of the gasket thickness is not the (complete) solution. . Changing the material of the end cover has been discussed, as I read in attached email. But I believe that there should not be any flow under the gasket area, and hence changing the material of the end cover is just a (very expensive) Band-Aid for an underlying problem. Could you please ask your engineering team to have a look at this, and support us in finding an explanation of the damage? Perhaps it is good to have a telephone call to discuss way forward on this topic?. UNQUOTE. When customer have opened a Boiler Feed Water (BFW) pump due to seal failure, the end cover of the pump is found to be eroded under the gasket surface. The customer suggests that changing the end cover material is just a Band-Aid for an underlying problem and that there should not be any flow under the gasket. They also suggest that the seal failure has been caused by the erosion on the end cover. . 1. sliding shoes doesn t required. 2. sent reccomendation to custoerm as per arttached mail. under customer decision', 'REF.

After an alarms analysis, was noted that the SUMP B (TGBBTMPALM) and C (TGBCTMPALM) high temperature alarm appeared around of 31st of May 2018. Also, several and intermittent alarms happened due to high synthetic oil vapor separator (L26SQV_1_ALM) sice March 2018.. Please find also attached the MKVIe xml file, which is an historical extract of alarms of the time frame between January 2018 and 11th of June 2018..

      "['On the 5th of June 2019 post the L1 service startup, the Train2 PR2 High Speed Power Turbine (HSPT) vibration readings on the casing accelerometer started trending up close to the trip limit of 25mm/s. The increase in the casing vibration is confirmed to be only on Tr2PR2 and not on other units. Multiple hypotheses exists ranging from residual varnish deposition on HSPT journal bearing 1, restriction in thermal growth, rotor unbalance, rotor-dynamics changes, and bearing 1 damage. The root cause of the casing vibration has not yet been determined. The most likely hypotheses are: 1. Actual mechanical damage on the HSPT bearings.. 2. The effects of MLO DTE-932 and residual varnish on this HSPT bearing 1. . From the current RM&D trend we could see that the vibration on the sesmic probe and the proximeter probes have reduced and the behaviour is consistent with the vibration levels observed prior to oil replacement activity during L1. Oil varnish is considered to be a contributing factor for the vibration spike. . With the above finding there is no requirement to increase the sesmic vibration limit from 25 mm/sec to 35 mm/sec, further after discussion with level 3 the sesmic vibration setpoint increase from 25mm/sec to 35mm/sec cannot be approved as this affects the HSPT integrity.', 'Seeking advise on ST problem. Good after noon, I am Kraisorn who response in rotating machine maintenance in Bangchak refinery.. We have problem about the steam turbine 4KT-4001.. Now, Governor open about 90% at speed 7,900 rpm. Normally we operate at 8,300 rpm but now can\\'t increase speed to that point.. We check the 1st stage pressure, It has trend to increase since mid of October until now this value is 38 bar (Inlet pressure 40 bar). The turbine NDE axial vibration change from -0.20 mm to -0.02 mm but other vibration are normal.. Could you please advise about this problem and how to check and method to solve this problem . Thank you for your support.. Here below the questions/answers exchanged during the call.. 1 While turbine run at speed around 7,500 rpm, can we introduce the superheat steam (Dry steam) but have margin temp. higher than saturated steam a little bit to washing the turbine ? In order to try washing the turbine the steam has to be saturated. Keeping a temperature in between the operating superheated and the saturated one would be not effective. Moreover, it\\'s strongly not advisable to play with the temperature while the turbine run at high speed, in fact possible water slugs could compromise the machine integrity. The steam may be condensed to wet steam after pass first or second stage and then washing the deposit on the stage after. Can we use this method to washing the turbine ? see above. How much the pressure and temperature that recommend ? see above. What are the concern for this method ? see above. 2 While washing turbine at 500 rpm, steam should be wetted before entrance the turbine that mean wet steam may be condensed before last stage. The washing may not efficient it can cause unbalance or vibration problem after washing or not. As already explained in the very first replies, vibration issues could happen after washing, but they would be not due to washing efficiency. Depending on the thickness and \\'hardness\\' of the deposits, they could be removed not evenly and therefore provoke unbalance. 3 From guide line no. 1-2, Why need to shut down the turbine and cool down casing to 100 C after that start up again to 1,500 rpm. The aim is to induce some thermal transients that should facilitate the deposits detaching (due to the different thermal expansion between steel and deposits). 4 When run turbine at 500 rpm, how to keep compressor run ? Because there are not enough pressure for sealing DGS. If you have not clean external buffer gas, this could be a problem.. 5 Can we remove coupling spacer then washing the turbine during solo run ? Governor valve can control turbine speed at 500 rpm when solo run or not. Usually Yes. 6 If governor valve cannot control speed at 500 rpm. Are there speed allowance for this procedure ? Less than 700 rpm. 7 Are there any detail procedure for wet steam washing ? Please submit to us. How much steam temperature decreasing rate when open BFW valve ? Depends on the plant arrangement. Best practice is always to look for temperature stabilization (about 5 minutes) before to increase the BFW opening.. 8 Please submit the control limit of conductivity (<0.1 mS/cm), SiO2 (< 5 ppm) or etc for BFW. BFW (Boiler Feed Water) properties provided are the ones we specify for a good operation of our steam turbines. What we can say is that the washing will be as much effective as the BFW properties will be closed to the specified. 9 Are there any procedure to clean turbine when turbine stop ? . For example, turbine stop we fill up water inside the turbine and then rotate shaft by turning device to rinse the contaminate and drain out.. Please advise. No. 10 Could you please advise start up step after washing finish ? . Should we stop the turbine to drain out or increase speed to 1,500 rpm and continue warming up ?. Are there need longer warm up than normally start up ?. During the washing, the machine drains shall be kept open (consequent loss of vacuum is not an issue). Once the washing is finished, slightly close the BFW valve and wait for the superheated temperature stabilization. Keep the temperature stable for 5 minutes and then close the drains.. From this point, increase the speed from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. Warm up for 10 minutes @ 1500 rpm and then follow the normal start-up ramps.. 11 Check the schedule of GE supervisor to supervise washing procedure as soon as possible. Joe to provide answer. 12 When washing turbine with 500 rpm, if there are BFW in liquid state go through the turbine. What\\'re the effect for turbine ? . Being the BFW valve Â½\" size, no major water slugs are expected. Moreover, making the washing at 500 rpm limits the risk of damages.. 13 From guide line item 1, Turbine shall cool down to 100 C. Kindly advise where is the position on the casing to measure temperature. Is it TI-530 or use infrared temp to check at casing surface ? OK. 14 Due to our time constrain, Are there any method to cool down the turbine faster than natural cool down ?Can we remove the insulation out to faster cool down ? Absolutely NOT . From your experience, can you advise estimate time for cool down the turbine ? 6-8 hours. 15 Kindly advise essentially concern and caution for startup after turbine washing finish. See point 10.

Comments on vibrations during 72hr test.. 1. Unstable behavior of axial compressor position at daytime. a. Main frequency about 2,6 Hz.. b. Why is it stable at night, but unstable at day?. BHGE comments: . Axial displacement behavior there can be due to process.. - Is the phenomena still present at site?. - Check out if we are within datasheet of the unit: â\\x80¢ gas composition. â\\x80¢ suction temperature. â\\x80¢ suction pressure. â\\x80¢ discharge pressure. - Check out process control above the compressor suction : â\\x80¢ no variation of 2,6Hz due to regulation (valve position). â\\x80¢ no suction/discharge variation? (pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï\\x83\\x98 Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â\\x80¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â\\x80¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â\\x80¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â\\x80¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï\\x83\\x98 As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. .\", \"Trending below is referred.. i.

GCM1 experienced radial high vibration trip when we tried to increase load after it reaches the minimum load with compressor speed 70%. Upon further investigation, findings are summarized as follow.. Sub-sync with broadband appeared in the radial bearing (DE,NDE) vibration spectrum indicating process instability. ASV 1 hunting as we tried to increase load. Suction piping between scrubber and compressor experienced high vibration. Upon further investigation, we found flow transmitter FT2411 faulty and giving flow reading even during unit not running. This evening, we managed to replace the transmitter and verified its functionality. As we proceed with start-up, we manage to reach minimum load with low vibration readings and the sub sync signal had disappeared. However, out of sudden CCC triggered Shut Down on Multiple Surges. I believe it is not genuine since thrust bearing temperature very low, radial vibration low, and axial position maintain. Safety On appeared in the alarm list but there was no Surge Count. Simultaneously after GCM1 tripped, all parameter readings at GCM3 HMI turned to zero. This situation happened twice tonight. It seems like there was an interruption in network communication between TCP, CCC, and HMI.. Please see the attached OSM alarm list and trends from the events.. As reported in the SR, customer has solved the issue at site. Basically the CCC calculated the wrong operating point during operation due to the Compressor Instrumentation failure. (Temperature/Pressure/Flow â\\x80\\x93 Compressor Parameters). Due to this reason CCC always initiate \"CCC Multiple Surge\" when it thinks that the compressor work not at the right operating point.

(see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. .

Client has been having some issues with a NP centrifugal compressor of the PtR Unit and they have done a lot of things to eliminate those issues but now they need a GE techinician to help them find the correct solution to this matter. . This compressor has a Lube & Seal Oil System, attached the diagrams. The mechanical seals are from EagleBurgman.. This is an overview of the differents troubles they are having. See the diagrams attached as a reference to the comments.. 1. Frequent failures of the mechanical seals. Sometimes this is because of the sudden loss of diferential pressure of the Seal Oil System.. 2. Poor hermeticity of the mechanical seals in the housing because of posible wrong selection of o\\'rings.. 3. A lot of oil flowing out the mechanical seals. The amount of oil we see in the flow oil glasses located in the drain lines is too much and apparently abnormal. We\\'ve checked the mechanical seals faces for excesive wear, craks, etc. and they\\'re most of the times \"OK\". No signs of separation of the faces that could get the oil flowing out them increased.. 4. Sudden lose of Reference and Equalization Gas, then the situation gets into control but sometimes it doesn\\'t and it makes dificult to maintain the system in control.. 5. Lube & Seal Oil System working with the main and auxiliary pump in service at the same time. When we try to get out of service one pump we get the diferential pressure decreased and it can shut down the compressor.. 6. Oil Accumulator Tank doesn\\'t respond as it should.. 7. A lot of instability and poor control of the system valves associated to Lube & Seal Oil System (PDCV, PCVs, etc.).. The problems mentioned above have been in this machine since the 90\\'s, in those years they received the assistance of some NP\\'s technicians, Burgmann\\'s technicians and others and they give some recomendations to eliminate those instability problems. The recomendations that they give were carried out and for several years they didn\\'t have problems but they are having similar problems right now.

According to SOS9973868 functional description: Very low pressure in the primary vent lines, meaning the secondary gas seal has failed, is detected by transmitters PZ-8035A/B/C (PZLL-8035, 2oo3 voting) and PZ-8041A/B/C (PZLL-8041, 2oo3 voting) and if the relative very low threshold (PZLL-8035 or PZLL8041, 10kPa) are exceeded for more than 10 seconds (continuative), this will result in a compressor trip without vent and related alarm indication.. Can we please ask BHGE Engineering if it is normal to see quite a low pressure in the primary vent of the HP compressors (as read on PZ-8035 and PZ-8041) during pressurized stand-still? . For example, when 3K-1901B tripped this week, with primary vent open to atmosphere and there was 190 kpag in the casing, PZI8541 read 17 kpag and PZI8535 read 13 kpag. This is quite normal values for us to see in the pressurized stand-still case and has the potential to cause us issues on re-starts as the trip setpoint is 10kpag. For the case of 2K-1901B, 319PZI8541 reads 10-11kpag and we have been required to force this when it dipped below 10 kpag for the nitrogen runs. It seems like a very tight margin from the pressures we are seeing in the primary vent to the trip set point. . On the base of provided data, it can be seen that valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 are completely open during pressurized stand-still condition and this fact explain the low pressure (close to trip threshold 10 Kpa) measured on primary vent by PT8034 and PT8038 during pressurized stand-still.. The condition to be forced 100% open for primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 during pressurized stand-still phase is not required (as confirmed by Control System Functional Description SOS9973868 sheet 10/23), so we suggest to remove the above said condition so that primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 will work as per design (regulating their opening in order to keep 1bar upstream themselves) during pressurized stand-still condition..

GTB tripped last night at full load on VSV position error and then the unit did not load reject well and the GG shaft went into over speed conditions during the shutdown.. See attached Trend of the event. • Highlighted sections in red show the VSVSEL and VSVDMD (VSV demand and feedback) tracking together and running ok at approx. 12%. Then drifting to 32.5% and 5% respectively they should be tracking equally. An error between the two of greater than 10% is a step to idle then trip. • Highlighted green sections show the GG shaft (NGGSEL) going into over speed conditions (greater than 10300 rpm) after the initial event.. The over speed trip was secondary to the VSV position error (see attached alarm screen and first out data) . However the governor should still control the turbine in a full load rejection condition without going into over speed. Although I suspect if the VSV did not move on schedule this would not have helped the issue.. From the trend you can see the VSV demand and feedback error. In my opinion this is what we should be concentrating on. I have attached the trouble shooting guides from the manual (TS18) (WP41100). . We plan to go in and have a look at the VSV system to see if there is anything obvious (ie loose cannon plugs or obvious signs of damage) After this is completed and if nothing obvious has been found we would like to know if further troubleshooting measure should be taken or what the next step would be to ensure safe return to operation.. .

      "['Manitowoc Public Utilities Frame 5 CT Issues. Background: The unit was last successfully started and run on 1/10 for a short run to test a new auto synchronizing relay. Temperatures were typical for Wisconsin at the time (25-30 degrees). Yesterday (1/30), we were requested to start our CT and be online at around 0500. Temperatures were about minus 20 degrees with blowing snow. We also had a significant snow fall on Monday (12+ inches) with major blowing and drifting. So that is the background for our start.. We started the unit on NG around 0500 in the morning and synched onto the grid. After our normal 10 minute warm up period at 2 MW load was increased to ~11.5 MW. The unit appeared to be stable and running at ~11.5 MW for just over 1/2 hour when it tripped. Unfortunately the exact cause is now a bit hard to determine as our control PLC is not logging alarm history (a separate issue we are looking into). While it was all happening, I ended up hitting a reset, thinking I could go back to the alarm history, but the history is not there. There were a number of alarms and I know at least one Shutdown alarm was OVERSPEED TRIP. However, we did not see indication that speed got that high (108%). If it did it was very short.. After the unit rolled down and became ready for a restart, we attempted a 2nd start. At about 60% speed the unit tripped on High Vibration of the #2 Turbine Bearing (Trips at 1 in/sec. velocity). The vibrations are definitely real, as we could feel it on the startup. We suspected the trip from load with the extreme cold temperatures could have caused a bow in the shaft. We left the unit on the jack for about 7 hours. We were again asked to run and attempted another start around 1400. This time the unit tripped on High Exhaust Gas Temp and High Vibration at the same time. Vibration has typically not been an issue with this unit, and we are at a loss as to the cause of the High EGT.. Finally, for some additional information, we looked at the trends from the initial run and trip and can see there were 4 or 5 instances of significant MW load spikes (2+ MW swings in very short time frame). These swings corresponds with spikes in the Inter-Stage Gas Pressure. I believe that the NG header pressure regulator was sticking, causing spikes in the supply header pressure as the unit was running. These spikes resulted in sudden power surges in the turbine, which ultimately lead to the trip.

The recycle valve is opening to values of 80-90% and it is apparently due to the detection of surge, therefore the surge control logic increases the setpoint of the controller forcing it to open faster. We havent been able to find process reasons for such a sudden change, but when looking at it closer our Rotating Equipment engineer has determined that the compressor is operating at incipient surge region, meaning that the Surge Control Line (SCL) is actually at the incipient surge region.. Unquote. . See attached mail customer agree to close the SR because they are going to shutdown the unit for UCP upgrade. But I still suggest to record the issue, keep the following information to the control requisition engineer in this upgrade in order to anticipate issue in future.. ----------------------------------. According to Walter's statement, if it is a sudden open instead of steady open, most likely the 'transient absorption' is ON. This is a designed regulation/protection, as a feature of anti-surge controller. Usually it be activated when process condition change ratio exceed a certain threshold. For example, fluctuation on flow measurement. If it is a steady open, it means operation point is approaching to SCL.. However, in order to help customer evaluate this 'transient absorption' activation event, we still need to start with data analysis. Please get the required data.. The possibilities will include but not limited to: . - A real process fluctuation. - A slight process fluctuation with a too sensitive detection parameter tuned. - A instrumentation / cabling issue which introduce noise in loop. - A steady operation with insufficient suction flow. About raised questions by customer: . Q1.Can we operate the KT-0401 in the long term with 40% (once in a while -95%) open recycle valves?. A: as for equipment itself, there is no issue. However, it is of energy waste. If ASV staying stable at 40%, that usually means there is not enough suction flow to feed compressor at that speed (if suction and discharge pressure ratio is to be maintained). Customer may consider lower compressor speed manually or regulated by process controller. After we receive the data, we can have more precise evaluation. . Q2.We may have to adjust the SCL even more to the right? Or have a study carried out how to modify the unit?. A: If the suction condition ( including suction temperature, pressure, gas molecular weight is not far away from designed condition, there is no need to shift SCL in general, unless the set SCL has issue which may be seen from data analysis and other check on e.g flow element sheet.

Previously for Train 1 PR 3MCL, 56\" flange was also discovered with pitting across more than 30% of the sealing surface. QA/QC of customer rejected the flange condition and the flange was machined on site (SR 90084714). . According to information shared we noted: - Flange conformity according to ASME is not guaranteed as stated in the attached documents. - We do not have a direct experience of how the flange could operate with such defects. - On train 1 a similar defect was re-machined at site.. In addition we cannot guarantee correct sealing of the flange and the risk of gas leakage during first pressurization could lead to perform re-machining after installation of customer piping with shorter time to operate and under customer pressure. For above reason we cannot consider to take the risk of leaving the flange as is and re-machining is required. .

Attached trend, it seems Temperature of axial bearing has reached more than 200 ÂºC.. Please treat this case as urgent. . Besides the dispositions provided during the forced outage to put the unit back in operation, eng worked on the RC of the issue. Most likely cause was the out of design coupling pre-stretch value found during dismantling. TI subcase opened..

During this phase is visible a synthetic oil leak from axial compressor stator blade (visible oil on the linkage in the attached picture) all around the machine.. We do not have past experiences on the LM6000.. Similar case happened on LM2500 was due to not enough seal air on the sump during the crank.. Our opinion is to increase the HP rotor speed to allow sufficient pressure of the air seal sump.. After several discussions and investigations, the unit was restarted successfully after inspecting the inner part of the FWD shaft for oil presence. Nothing major was found.. Attached an email summarizing the verifications done.. Instructions and checks provided to investigate synthetic oil possible leakage.', 'please be aware that, following the Steam Turbine Start-Up carried out on the past Friday 2nd of August, the below listed issues still affect the machine: . • 1. Excess of sealing system steam consumption. The sealing systema steam consumption is much greater than in the run before the Steam Turbine Overhaul. In fact, the steam flowing throw the PV-123 is about 230 kg/h (against about 190 kg/h in the previous run at a PIC-123 pressure set equal to 0,3 barg;. • 2. Fault of the Axial Displacement Sensor ZT-52-0304B. The axial displacement sensor failed and the following alarms are displayed in the Steam Turbine HMI: . o PLC1.BNALM.ZAH520304B;. o PLC1.BNALM.Z_NOK520304B;. o PLC1.BNALM.ZAHH520304B.. Please urgently provide us with the remedial actions to put in place in order to restore the safe and reliable conditions of the machine run.. Looking forward your urgent reply I ask you to dedicate to Sper the due attention as per the Contract in place and the Client history. 1- excessive steam leakage: according to client answers (attached), the flow is measured (and increase of temperature in the flash tank), so there are no doubt about increase in flow. The operating conditions are also same as before. we reviewed the clearance record from site and we had comments and found 2 factors that may explain the excessive leaks compared to design (attached powerpoint presentation). After discussion with the FSE, the measurement were the same at dissassembly and reassembly. There did not replace the seals as they were in good condition. Due to short outage timing, discrepencies observed were noted in the report and shall be taken into account for preparation of next major overhaul (fixed seals damaged (radial - axial), removed, diaphrams damaged).. The difference of leak before and after outage of 40 kg/h described by client could therefore be explained : . -potential abnormal working condition of the steam gland condenser. -cleaning of the rotor that may have generate small additional clearance at some locations.. 2- client accept the plan described in first reply above about loss of ZT.. ras', 'customer looking for high CO emission issue solution for their LM6000PH+ unit SN 192-420.

Based on the latest results received from Site, we observed that the unit is having troubles in reaching the crank speed. The desired purge speed was barely reached but having always the swash plate at 100%. Several pressure measurements were taken on the circuit to locate the possible source of the issue, after the latest adjustment on the Max Flow the unit was able to reach the crank speed. This seems to indicate there is a lack of flow on the oil circuit that was somehow compensated by the Max Flow adjustment. Investigation shown a fair response of 90HS valve, while there is seems to be a possible leakage from the solenoid 20HS. This point will be checked further using a thermo camera that will be provided from customer. Most likely the issue is on 20HS which we recommend to be replaced as next step. As part of the troubleshooting we recommend to procure also a new 90HS block. Site team requested also gaskets related to filter to be replaced as part of this investigation.

After involving the process operability team, we confirm that the valve in subject must be operated always in manual. The purpose is to heat up the suction to avoid hydrates formation.

Usually rather than the liner condition, if the overheating is seen only with crank end loaded, the condition of the suction and discharge valves shall be verified. In general in any case when only one of the two cylinder ends is loaded the discharge temperature tends to increase but again we need measured values to estimated this. Valve cover skin temperature, measured with infrared probe, may also give an idea about thermodynamic behavior..

      "['Gorgon CO2 project. Seal gas system. According to SOS9973868 functional description: Very low pressure in the primary vent lines, meaning the secondary gas seal has failed, is detected by transmitters PZ-8035A/B/C (PZLL-8035, 2oo3 voting) and PZ-8041A/B/C (PZLL-8041, 2oo3 voting) and if the relative very low threshold (PZLL-8035 or PZLL8041, 10kPa) are exceeded for more than 10 seconds (continuative), this will result in a compressor trip without vent and related alarm indication.. Can we please ask BHGE Engineering if it is normal to see quite a low pressure in the primary vent of the HP compressors (as read on PZ-8035 and PZ-8041) during pressurized stand-still? . For example, when 3K-1901B tripped this week, with primary vent open to atmosphere and there was 190 kpag in the casing, PZI8541 read 17 kpag and PZI8535 read 13 kpag. This is quite normal values for us to see in the pressurized stand-still case and has the potential to cause us issues on re-starts as the trip setpoint is 10kpag. For the case of 2K-1901B, 319PZI8541 reads 10-11kpag and we have been required to force this when it dipped below 10 kpag for the nitrogen runs. It seems like a very tight margin from the pressures we are seeing in the primary vent to the trip set point. . On the base of provided data, it can be seen that valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 are completely open during pressurized stand-still condition and this fact explain the low pressure (close to trip threshold 10 Kpa) measured on primary vent by PT8034 and PT8038 during pressurized stand-still.. The condition to be forced 100% open for primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 during pressurized stand-still phase is not required (as confirmed by Control System Functional Description SOS9973868 sheet 10/23), so we suggest to remove the above said condition so that primary vent valves PCV 8034 & PCV 8038 will work as per design (regulating their opening in order to keep 1bar upstream themselves) during pressurized stand-still condition..

For what concern the midplane of the cover, it is also suggested to try with a nut splitter tool. Instead for what concern the damaged lifting eye threaded holes on the top cover, we agree with dril and tap oversize (for example from M12 to M16). The new eyebolts will have to be screwed completely in the new healthy thread. The solution to weld a small metal block on the cover and install a lifting eye for top half cover lifting (in the same position to respect the gravity center), can be accepted, only with a dedicated WPS to be applied.. 2) The codes of the suggested spare items (it is not clear if the pictures provided refer to the thrust or opposite thrust side of the compressor are): .

Whether or not the following sequence is acceptable: . a) 1st Tuning of GTGx, GTGx can go Pre-Mix . b) Copy parameters from GTGx and copy to GTGy. GTGy can go to Pre-Mix . c) Both GTGx and GTGy to undergo 2nd Tuning once final fuel gas is available . . 1. What is the impact of running the GT after DLN tuning using different fuel gas (only emissions or other concerns) ? DLN tuning is not required if new fuel gas is within +/-5% of MWI from tuning gas.. In case of MWI difference greater than +/-5% DLN tuning is needed for avoiding any risk of high emission/combustion dynamics.. 2.

We have recently removed the end cover of the B pump, due to seal failure, and found that the end cover had again eroded under the gasket surface. For this pump the gasket thickness was reduced in October last year, then also the end cover had extensive repair due to erosion. Now it is clear that the reduction of the gasket thickness is not the (complete) solution. . Changing the material of the end cover has been discussed, as I read in attached email. But I believe that there should not be any flow under the gasket area, and hence changing the material of the end cover is just a (very expensive) Band-Aid for an underlying problem. Could you please ask your engineering team to have a look at this, and support us in finding an explanation of the damage? Perhaps it is good to have a telephone call to discuss way forward on this topic?. UNQUOTE.

Daniele and Antonio, good morning,. As per experience overheating we don't see direct reading of the measured discharge temperature of the cylinder, to better understand the phenomena we need to have these values. Usually rather than the liner condition, if the overheating is seen only with crank end loaded, the condition of the suction and discharge valves shall be verified. In general in any case when only one of the two cylinder ends is loaded the discharge temperature tends to increase but again we need measured values to estimated this. Valve cover skin temperature, measured with infrared probe, may also give an idea about thermodynamic behavior..

The customer reported the following conditions: 1. the discharge pressure of the main LO pump gradually increases up to 12.8 barg as the header pressure drops. 2. a LO leakage is observed in the back plate of the main lube oil pump (~30 drops/min) . 3. the VPR-1 is opened ~20% vs. 50% previously observed in normal conditions. 4. the replacement of the VR-1 with the VR-1 removed from Train A (currently under scheduled maintenance) did not sort out the problem (the LO system had exactly the same behavior). 5. the LO header temperature is ~60 degC and did not dropped even when the customer switched to a new cooler (in previous occasions it was observed that the new cooler was able to drop the LO temperature to 55 degC).. The customer is in progress to replace the VPR-1 and the main LO pump with those installed in Train A (no spares available on the platform).. To troubleshoot lube oil pressure issue, customer replaced VR-1, VPR-1 and main lube oil.. The lube oil cooler three way valve was found in partial open position i.e. meaning cooler was not lined up properly.. Probably incorrect position of cooler three way valve was creating more differential pressure and low cooling effect.. After correcting cooler valve position and VR-1, VPR-1 and main lube oil replacement , unit started without any issues.. -', 'CUstomer had some issue with coolling system (ice inside the coolling system) and decided to inspect the cooling exchanger of the motor KA3002. Customer change the gasket that was damaged (Cf picture). then a did a leak at 3barG with air. as he found some leak (most likely internal), he decided to make a pressure test with water at 3barG. He left the system pressurize with water at 3barG for all the night he found it at 2barG the morning. he removed the tubing of the level switch (connected to the cooling cartrdige of the motor) and let a bottle all the night. We found the morning few ml of water inside the bottle.. Investigation with ABB (OEM) covered up that there was a wrong piping connection of the level switch. It was then collecting the water at the gasket location, giving a wrong indication of the internal leakage.. The customer corrected the piping connection and did a leakage test that confirmed the cooler was in good condition.. Motor assembly mistake at supplier workshop.', 'P77- OFFSHORE.

After involving the process operability team, we confirm that the valve in subject must be operated always in manual. The purpose is to heat up the suction to avoid hydrates formation.

GTB tripped last night at full load on VSV position error and then the unit did not load reject well and the GG shaft went into over speed conditions during the shutdown.. See attached Trend of the event. • Highlighted sections in red show the VSVSEL and VSVDMD (VSV demand and feedback) tracking together and running ok at approx. 12%. Then drifting to 32.5% and 5% respectively they should be tracking equally. An error between the two of greater than 10% is a step to idle then trip. • Highlighted green sections show the GG shaft (NGGSEL) going into over speed conditions (greater than 10300 rpm) after the initial event.. The over speed trip was secondary to the VSV position error (see attached alarm screen and first out data) . However the governor should still control the turbine in a full load rejection condition without going into over speed. Although I suspect if the VSV did not move on schedule this would not have helped the issue.. From the trend you can see the VSV demand and feedback error. In my opinion this is what we should be concentrating on. I have attached the trouble shooting guides from the manual (TS18) (WP41100). . We plan to go in and have a look at the VSV system to see if there is anything obvious (ie loose cannon plugs or obvious signs of damage) After this is completed and if nothing obvious has been found we would like to know if further troubleshooting measure should be taken or what the next step would be to ensure safe return to operation.. .

Currently the manual says we should have an suction filter DP alarm at 0.3bar which is 4.3 psi however we do not have DP transmitter but gauges which are 0 to 800 psi so 4 psi is not discernable on the gauge..

The recycle valve is opening to values of 80-90% and it is apparently due to the detection of surge, therefore the surge control logic increases the setpoint of the controller forcing it to open faster. We havent been able to find process reasons for such a sudden change, but when looking at it closer our Rotating Equipment engineer has determined that the compressor is operating at incipient surge region, meaning that the Surge Control Line (SCL) is actually at the incipient surge region..

But I still suggest to record the issue, keep the following information to the control requisition engineer in this upgrade in order to anticipate issue in future.. ----------------------------------. According to Walter's statement, if it is a sudden open instead of steady open, most likely the 'transient absorption' is ON. This is a designed regulation/protection, as a feature of anti-surge controller. Usually it be activated when process condition change ratio exceed a certain threshold. For example, fluctuation on flow measurement. If it is a steady open, it means operation point is approaching to SCL.. However, in order to help customer evaluate this 'transient absorption' activation event, we still need to start with data analysis. Please get the required data.. The possibilities will include but not limited to: . - A real process fluctuation. - A slight process fluctuation with a too sensitive detection parameter tuned. - A instrumentation / cabling issue which introduce noise in loop. - A steady operation with insufficient suction flow. About raised questions by customer: . Q1.Can we operate the KT-0401 in the long term with 40% (once in a while -95%) open recycle valves?. A: as for equipment itself, there is no issue. However, it is of energy waste. If ASV staying stable at 40%, that usually means there is not enough suction flow to feed compressor at that speed (if suction and discharge pressure ratio is to be maintained). Customer may consider lower compressor speed manually or regulated by process controller. After we receive the data, we can have more precise evaluation. . Q2.We may have to adjust the SCL even more to the right? Or have a study carried out how to modify the unit?. A: If the suction condition ( including suction temperature, pressure, gas molecular weight is not far away from designed condition, there is no need to shift SCL in general, unless the set SCL has issue which may be seen from data analysis and other check on e.g flow element sheet.

We have observed that in TK2 some more Capture Block is added (in AUX and LOAD module) (compared to TK1) which contains other process signals as well.We have to select the critical signals among all and configure same. The reason behind the error is because of the number of signals added in the Capture Block, which is actually exceeding the controller memory limit. Normally based on the controller memory and some tests performed with Capture block we could add approx. 260 signals (4 digital signals = 1 analog signal).

Burst rapture disk picture has been attached... See reply of Suthar Mitesh.', 'Manitowoc Public Utilities Frame 5 CT Issues. Background: The unit was last successfully started and run on 1/10 for a short run to test a new auto synchronizing relay. Temperatures were typical for Wisconsin at the time (25-30 degrees). Yesterday (1/30), we were requested to start our CT and be online at around 0500. Temperatures were about minus 20 degrees with blowing snow. We also had a significant snow fall on Monday (12+ inches) with major blowing and drifting. So that is the background for our start.. We started the unit on NG around 0500 in the morning and synched onto the grid. After our normal 10 minute warm up period at 2 MW load was increased to ~11.5 MW. The unit appeared to be stable and running at ~11.5 MW for just over 1/2 hour when it tripped. Unfortunately the exact cause is now a bit hard to determine as our control PLC is not logging alarm history (a separate issue we are looking into). While it was all happening, I ended up hitting a reset, thinking I could go back to the alarm history, but the history is not there. There were a number of alarms and I know at least one Shutdown alarm was OVERSPEED TRIP. However, we did not see indication that speed got that high (108%). If it did it was very short.. After the unit rolled down and became ready for a restart, we attempted a 2nd start. At about 60% speed the unit tripped on High Vibration of the #2 Turbine Bearing (Trips at 1 in/sec. velocity). The vibrations are definitely real, as we could feel it on the startup. We suspected the trip from load with the extreme cold temperatures could have caused a bow in the shaft. We left the unit on the jack for about 7 hours. We were again asked to run and attempted another start around 1400. This time the unit tripped on High Exhaust Gas Temp and High Vibration at the same time. Vibration has typically not been an issue with this unit, and we are at a loss as to the cause of the High EGT.. Finally, for some additional information, we looked at the trends from the initial run and trip and can see there were 4 or 5 instances of significant MW load spikes (2+ MW swings in very short time frame). These swings corresponds with spikes in the Inter-Stage Gas Pressure. I believe that the NG header pressure regulator was sticking, causing spikes in the supply header pressure as the unit was running. These spikes resulted in sudden power surges in the turbine, which ultimately lead to the trip.

Looking forward your urgent reply I ask you to dedicate to Sper the due attention as per the Contract in place and the Client history. 1- excessive steam leakage: according to client answers (attached), the flow is measured (and increase of temperature in the flash tank), so there are no doubt about increase in flow. The operating conditions are also same as before. we reviewed the clearance record from site and we had comments and found 2 factors that may explain the excessive leaks compared to design (attached powerpoint presentation). After discussion with the FSE, the measurement were the same at dissassembly and reassembly. There did not replace the seals as they were in good condition. Due to short outage timing, discrepencies observed were noted in the report and shall be taken into account for preparation of next major overhaul (fixed seals damaged (radial - axial), removed, diaphrams damaged).. The difference of leak before and after outage of 40 kg/h described by client could therefore be explained : . -potential abnormal working condition of the steam gland condenser. -cleaning of the rotor that may have generate small additional clearance at some locations.. 2- client accept the plan described in first reply above about loss of ZT.. ras', \"The Turbine and Compressor Foundations have not been accomplished as per NP Drawing Specifications.The Foundation Bolts aren't in line (See Pictures Attached) and in proper verticality,causing the positioning of the Turbine out of centerline..

Based on the latest results received from Site, we observed that the unit is having troubles in reaching the crank speed. The desired purge speed was barely reached but having always the swash plate at 100%. Several pressure measurements were taken on the circuit to locate the possible source of the issue, after the latest adjustment on the Max Flow the unit was able to reach the crank speed. This seems to indicate there is a lack of flow on the oil circuit that was somehow compensated by the Max Flow adjustment. Investigation shown a fair response of 90HS valve, while there is seems to be a possible leakage from the solenoid 20HS. This point will be checked further using a thermo camera that will be provided from customer. Most likely the issue is on 20HS which we recommend to be replaced as next step.

(pressure, flow, temperature)?. ï\\x83\\x98 Anyhow values and variations obtained are within BHGE acceptance.. 2. External or internal alignment of pinion shaft in gearbox.. a. At start, the pinion shaft starts at high position in NDE, but at a low position at DE.. b. During the run it stays high at NDE and low at DE, despite the full load on the gearbox.. c. We still have doubts about the alignments between compressor and gearbox and are wondering what is happening between cold alignment and hot condition of compressor and oil system. d. Gearbox is relative short in axial direction. There is no bellow between oil drain pipe and gearbox. The oil drain pipe can have influence on the alignment, when the temperature of the pipe is changing. e. What are the influences of the discharge pipe and gearbox oil drain pipe on the alignment?. â\\x80¢ Pinion drive-end side is landed in standstill in the bottom of the journal bearing (coupling overhung weight) and then lifted-up to more than half the diametrical clearance at nominal speed.. â\\x80¢ The shaft-line is equipped of a flexible coupling that can handle relatively high deflection. â\\x80¢ No evidence of 2X component on the spectrum on both pinion & compressor that would be the sign of a significant misalignment. â\\x80¢ The radial direct vibration recorded on the pinion at both journal bearings is stable and relatively limited in continuous operation at nominal speed (<10Âµm). ï\\x83\\x98 As a conclusion we do not see any issue on this shaft line.. 3. At DE compressor the shaft position is going down when the compressor and discharge is heating up.. a. What is the reason for that?. BHGE comments: it is a stabilization behavior, note that first is going up. What is important is stabilization after heating up and in total position variation we have only a lift up which is in accordance with expectations.. 4. At NDE compressor we see a small 2X amplitude with reverse precession. a. With slowroll compensation it is only 2um, so it's probably only caused by a shaft run-out at the probe area.. b. Orbit is also a little bit flattened, but values are low.. c. Is this acceptable for this machine?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable. No comments.. 5. DE motor shaft center line is changing in vertical direction during the run.. a. Is this acceptable?. BHGE comments: This is acceptable.. .\", \"Trending below is referred.. i.

      "['On the 5th of June 2019 post the L1 service startup, the Train2 PR2 High Speed Power Turbine (HSPT) vibration readings on the casing accelerometer started trending up close to the trip limit of 25mm/s. The increase in the casing vibration is confirmed to be only on Tr2PR2 and not on other units. Multiple hypotheses exists ranging from residual varnish deposition on HSPT journal bearing 1, restriction in thermal growth, rotor unbalance, rotor-dynamics changes, and bearing 1 damage. The root cause of the casing vibration has not yet been determined. The most likely hypotheses are: 1. Actual mechanical damage on the HSPT bearings.. 2. The effects of MLO DTE-932 and residual varnish on this HSPT bearing 1. . From the current RM&D trend we could see that the vibration on the sesmic probe and the proximeter probes have reduced and the behaviour is consistent with the vibration levels observed prior to oil replacement activity during L1. Oil varnish is considered to be a contributing factor for the vibration spike. . With the above finding there is no requirement to increase the sesmic vibration limit from 25 mm/sec to 35 mm/sec, further after discussion with level 3 the sesmic vibration setpoint increase from 25mm/sec to 35mm/sec cannot be approved as this affects the HSPT integrity.', 'Seeking advise on ST problem. Good after noon, I am Kraisorn who response in rotating machine maintenance in Bangchak refinery.. We have problem about the steam turbine 4KT-4001.. Now, Governor open about 90% at speed 7,900 rpm. Normally we operate at 8,300 rpm but now can\\'t increase speed to that point.. We check the 1st stage pressure, It has trend to increase since mid of October until now this value is 38 bar (Inlet pressure 40 bar). The turbine NDE axial vibration change from -0.20 mm to -0.02 mm but other vibration are normal.. Could you please advise about this problem and how to check and method to solve this problem . Thank you for your support.. Here below the questions/answers exchanged during the call.. 1 While turbine run at speed around 7,500 rpm, can we introduce the superheat steam (Dry steam) but have margin temp. higher than saturated steam a little bit to washing the turbine ? In order to try washing the turbine the steam has to be saturated. Keeping a temperature in between the operating superheated and the saturated one would be not effective. Moreover, it\\'s strongly not advisable to play with the temperature while the turbine run at high speed, in fact possible water slugs could compromise the machine integrity. The steam may be condensed to wet steam after pass first or second stage and then washing the deposit on the stage after. Can we use this method to washing the turbine ? see above. How much the pressure and temperature that recommend ? see above. What are the concern for this method ? see above. 2 While washing turbine at 500 rpm, steam should be wetted before entrance the turbine that mean wet steam may be condensed before last stage. The washing may not efficient it can cause unbalance or vibration problem after washing or not. As already explained in the very first replies, vibration issues could happen after washing, but they would be not due to washing efficiency. Depending on the thickness and \\'hardness\\' of the deposits, they could be removed not evenly and therefore provoke unbalance. 3 From guide line no. 1-2, Why need to shut down the turbine and cool down casing to 100 C after that start up again to 1,500 rpm. The aim is to induce some thermal transients that should facilitate the deposits detaching (due to the different thermal expansion between steel and deposits). 4 When run turbine at 500 rpm, how to keep compressor run ? Because there are not enough pressure for sealing DGS. If you have not clean external buffer gas, this could be a problem.. 5 Can we remove coupling spacer then washing the turbine during solo run ? Governor valve can control turbine speed at 500 rpm when solo run or not. Usually Yes. 6 If governor valve cannot control speed at 500 rpm. Are there speed allowance for this procedure ? Less than 700 rpm. 7 Are there any detail procedure for wet steam washing ? Please submit to us. How much steam temperature decreasing rate when open BFW valve ? Depends on the plant arrangement. Best practice is always to look for temperature stabilization (about 5 minutes) before to increase the BFW opening.. 8 Please submit the control limit of conductivity (<0.1 mS/cm), SiO2 (< 5 ppm) or etc for BFW. BFW (Boiler Feed Water) properties provided are the ones we specify for a good operation of our steam turbines. What we can say is that the washing will be as much effective as the BFW properties will be closed to the specified. 9 Are there any procedure to clean turbine when turbine stop ? . For example, turbine stop we fill up water inside the turbine and then rotate shaft by turning device to rinse the contaminate and drain out.. Please advise. No. 10 Could you please advise start up step after washing finish ? . Should we stop the turbine to drain out or increase speed to 1,500 rpm and continue warming up ?. Are there need longer warm up than normally start up ?. During the washing, the machine drains shall be kept open (consequent loss of vacuum is not an issue). Once the washing is finished, slightly close the BFW valve and wait for the superheated temperature stabilization. Keep the temperature stable for 5 minutes and then close the drains.. From this point, increase the speed from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. Warm up for 10 minutes @ 1500 rpm and then follow the normal start-up ramps.. 11 Check the schedule of GE supervisor to supervise washing procedure as soon as possible. Joe to provide answer. 12 When washing turbine with 500 rpm, if there are BFW in liquid state go through the turbine. What\\'re the effect for turbine ? . Being the BFW valve Â½\" size, no major water slugs are expected. Moreover, making the washing at 500 rpm limits the risk of damages.. 13 From guide line item 1, Turbine shall cool down to 100 C. Kindly advise where is the position on the casing to measure temperature. Is it TI-530 or use infrared temp to check at casing surface ? OK. 14 Due to our time constrain, Are there any method to cool down the turbine faster than natural cool down ?Can we remove the insulation out to faster cool down ? Absolutely NOT . From your experience, can you advise estimate time for cool down the turbine ? 6-8 hours. 15 Kindly advise essentially concern and caution for startup after turbine washing finish. See point 10. Tech question', 'Crank test.. during Crank test preparation we found that there was a trip signal generated by Bently neveda.. After check found the voltage gap for 2 sensor were as below. 1-MBK01CY914/X was reading -12.5V. 2-MBK01CY914/Y was reading -8.5V. We adjust these prob and rest the trip signal.. Crank test done well and there was no vibration trip.. next day we found that the Gap voltage return back to the wrong value . We have noted vibration reading increased on High Speed Shaft of Gear Box on both DE and NDE End. . We suggest to exchange field wiring for MBK01CY912/X and MBK01CY912/Y with MBK01CY916/X and MBK01CY916/Y respectively. Similarly exchange field wiring for MBK01CY914/X and MBK01CY914/Y with MBK01CY918/X and MBK01CY918/Y. This means wiring from Proximitor to BN Rack will be exchange with another signal. This is to understand if there is any issue with regarding field wiring or electrical noise creating this problem. . Please perform this test, and collect the trend as taken before including probe gap voltage and direct reading. . If problem remain exists in the respective probes, this indicates some issue with probe adapter installed on LGB, this requires further inverstiagation by consulting LUFKIN..', 'Shell Scotofrd is experiencing a knock on the dummy cylinder of their C2620 compressor which is getting worse every day, per the attached e-mail with a video clip..

Anomalous varnish was detected inside the frame, Customer is providing for characterization.. During MRT, the machine was perfect, as well as the restart under load.. Case requestor suggested the closure of the case based on this feedback. . Customer provided for inspecting the compressor as recommended, only anomalous substance was found inside the frame, with no clear relation to the detected noise. Compressor internals was checked and cleaned, a complete major inspection planned. Upon restart compressor was ok, the intermittent noise was no longer present.', 'Attached the mail of customer for the detail of the event.. the site requires the following . 1.review the data andd explain the severity of the rubbing issue in terms of rotor as well as overall machine integrity and safety for continuous operation. 2.how higher suction pressure can also cause high vibrations in the rotor at critical speeds, other than condensate or moisture. hi Tony. The data were reviewed and it is recommended to turn on the turning gear immediately after shutdown (no more than 15 minutes of shutdown) until next start or max of 24 hours. .

Kind Regards. Francesco.', \". Co2 IP compressor rotor was replaced early Decemebr due to a very high vibration on compressor. The rotor was subjected to heavy rubbing specially between balance drum and balance drum seal. The rotor was extracted from casing along with balance drum seal (Photo attached). Customer did not try to remove the balance drum in order to avoid losing any information or observations that may be useful for conducting RCA.. Customer is sending the seal along with the balance drum seal and also end shaft seal which was also subjected to heavy rub and got partially melted. .

According to our initial analysis, it is likely that there is a bow on the rotor. One of the possible improvement options that we think of is slow rolling the machine. Here we have couple of questions for Nuovo Pignone as the OEM of this machine.. - What is the slow roll speed for this machine? . - Is there a minimum RPM limitation for slow rolling due to lubrication properties? . - Is there an OEM procedure for rotor stretching? .

After a maintenance it is suggested to maintain the the turbine shaft @ Turning gear speed for 14 hours at minimum and with seals bufferized by steam Steam.', 'RMD received the following email today from the customer following a high vibration trip notification issued to them-. GCM1 experienced radial high vibration trip when we tried to increase load after it reaches the minimum load with compressor speed 70%. Upon further investigation, findings are summarized as follow.. Sub-sync with broadband appeared in the radial bearing (DE,NDE) vibration spectrum indicating process instability. ASV 1 hunting as we tried to increase load. Suction piping between scrubber and compressor experienced high vibration. Upon further investigation, we found flow transmitter FT2411 faulty and giving flow reading even during unit not running. This evening, we managed to replace the transmitter and verified its functionality. As we proceed with start-up, we manage to reach minimum load with low vibration readings and the sub sync signal had disappeared. However, out of sudden CCC triggered Shut Down on Multiple Surges. I believe it is not genuine since thrust bearing temperature very low, radial vibration low, and axial position maintain. Safety On appeared in the alarm list but there was no Surge Count. Simultaneously after GCM1 tripped, all parameter readings at GCM3 HMI turned to zero. This situation happened twice tonight. It seems like there was an interruption in network communication between TCP, CCC, and HMI.. Please see the attached OSM alarm list and trends from the events.. As reported in the SR, customer has solved the issue at site. Basically the CCC calculated the wrong operating point during operation due to the Compressor Instrumentation failure. (Temperature/Pressure/Flow â\\x80\\x93 Compressor Parameters). Due to this reason CCC always initiate \"CCC Multiple Surge\" when it thinks that the compressor work not at the right operating point. After Replacement/Calibration/Range Change for the related instrument, The issue has been solved and the machine currently running with load. . regards. Tommaso. Support has been requested on potential causes for the CCC Surge shutdowns.', 'The instrument and piping supports IPLTE6051022 and IPLTE6031022 installed on the AUX SKID IPLSC0201022 are experiencing high vibration when the unit is running at high torque.. following discussion between Olivier Suard and Maurizio Bini, Ok to add additonal support on this part directly on site.

The supplier of turning gear replied that something was done or happened within 7 days which has an influence on TG behavior.. Basing on received data we are not able to give a solution at this moment.. Within the next turning gear operation please control the trend and carry out the spectrum.. Please involve the supplier to do the inspection of TG and Gearbox during the next overhaul.. Technical clarification.', 'Saturday 2nd June at 23:02:40 the Refrigeration steam turbine trip for HH vibration at Journal bearing Drive End (8501VAHH0857X). (see attached pictures of Event and Alarm and trip list). The compressor was set in manual around 20:30 due to process fluctuation but anyway stabilized before the trip. . Due to the following reasons: - absence of any signal of temperature and vibration increasing before the trip . - every turbine trip is normally followed by a vibration peak. as discussed this morning, we were thinking to some analogies with the problem of the timer in the Syngas compressor logic (August 2017- despite we know was checked also in the ref unit in August.. maybe similar other issue). However after extending the analysis of the trend to the previous weeks, we had in May 2018 (see attached trends) other peaks in the same position.. This peaks were never noticed during operation because very quick and just below the high alarm (70Âµm/s) . So probably is really a problem related to vibration perhaps spurious value due to probe failure?. . In first analysis I suppose that this TRIP was cause from an issue on PESS (PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC SAFETY SYSTEM) from customer side.. The customer could verify the wiring connection and screw tightening..
